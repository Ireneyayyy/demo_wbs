Bruce Jenner, who said he has long suffered from gender confusion and told ABC earlier this year that he identifies as a woman, was re-introduced to the world as Caitlyn Jenner on June 1 with a flashy photo spread and feature story in Vanity Fair magazine.

Follow us:\",\n          \"Broadway star Jennifer Holliday has backed out as a performer at next week's presidential inaugural, saying she did not realize that her participation would be interpreted as a statement of support for President-elect Donald Trump.  Jennifer Holliday is backing out of performing at Trump's inauguration celebration after receiving backlash from her fans. Kareem Quow for KQ Photography  Holliday, best known for her Tony-winning role in Broadway's \\\"Dreamgirls,\\\" faced pressure from her gay, lesbian and black fans when it was announced she would sing at a Thursday concert at Washington's Lincoln Memorial.  Holliday said in a statement Saturday that she apologized for her lapse of judgment, for being uneducated on the issues and causing heartbreak for her fans.  Several prominent entertainers have declined to perform at Trump inaugural festivities. Country star Toby Keith and actor Jon Voigt are in the lineup for Thursday's concert.  Holliday's reversal was first reported by The Wrap; the publication obtained a letter Holliday wrote to her fans. Her representative, Bill Carpenter, confirmed the details in the letter to The Associated Press.  \\\"My only choice must now be to stand with the LGBT Community and to state unequivocally that I WILL NOT PERFORM FOR THE WELCOME CONCERT OR FOR ANY OF THE INAUGURATION FESTIVITIES!\\\" she wrote.  \\\"Please know that I HEAR YOU and I feel your pain. The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you,\\\" she added. \\\"You have loved me faithfully and unconditionally and for so many years you provided me with work even though my star had long since faded.\\\"  Related: Toby Keith, 3 Doors Down to Play Inauguration-Related Event  In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Holliday defended her decision to perform at the inauguration.  \\\"I didn't see it as singing for Trump; I saw it as singing for the people on the mall,\\\" Holliday told the AP.  The performer, who most recently starred on Broadway in \\\"The Color Purple,\\\" said she was hurt by the angry backlash, which included calls to boycott her music. Others called her \\\"Uncle Tom\\\" and there was even a suggestion that she take her own life.  \\\"It just really made my heart drop to my feet,\\\" Holliday said. \\\"How could I have this much hate spewing at me, and I haven't even done anything? I guess it's not like those old days when political views were your own and you had freedom of speech. ... We live in a different time now, and a decision to go and do something for America is not so clear-cut anymore.\\\"  Holliday was to perform at the \\\"Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration\\\" which included Keith, Voight, and Trump himself.  The celebrity wattage for Trump's inaugural festivities doesn't rival that of Barack Obama's inaugurations, which attracted top names including Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Alicia Keys, Kelly Clarkson, Eva Longoria and Jennifer Hudson, among others. But Trump has insisted that's how he wants it, saying the swearing-in festivities should be about the people, not the A-list stars.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" so they felt she should be the one moved off the pole\",\n          \"1\",\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Pippa was recently seen at Princess Eugenie's wedding , and is thought to be due in the coming weeks.\n",

Add Interest  “We have a wedding dress designer,\" said Scobie, also a royal biographer. \"Meghan flew in her close friend and bridal stylist Jessica Mulroney from Toronto to London last weekend where she attended a top-secret fitting at Kensington Palace with the designer.\"  i-Images/Polaris  He added, \"They've tried on a number of different designs and are currently whittling it down to pick the best design for the day.”  Markle invited Mulroney, her best friend and stylist, to her new home with Harry -- Nottingham Cottage on the grounds of Kensington Palace -- to create a bespoke, custom-made dress for her wedding day.  George Pimentel/Getty Images  “During the process, Meghan expressed the desire to wear something simple and classy and very elegant,\" Scobie said. \"I think we'll see her go down that route for the wedding day as well.”  Mulroney’s four-day visit to Kensington Palace last week also allowed Markle and Mulroney to start reviewing plans for the May 19, 2018, wedding and reception. Mulroney, also a bridal planner, is assisting Markle in the entire design and concept of the wedding party outfits and look for the reception.  “Jessica Mulroney has a rich history when it comes to ... wedding planning and bridal styling,\" Scobie said. \"It's not just the dress she's involved in. She's actually helping with a number of elements for the big day and I think Meghan is really relying heavily on her expertise and a lot of the decision she has to make, and there are many.\"  Harry, the fifth in line to the throne, has \"made himself scarce\" when it comes to the wedding planning, Scobie said.  Tim Rooke/REX/Shutterstock  “Harry made himself scarce, giving the girls plenty of private time to kind of have their meetings with the designers and, of course, choose other wedding elements,\" he said. \"Harry's kind of made it clear that he wants to make this about Meghan.\"  The bride and groom have yet to send out formal wedding invitations but they have been telling close friends to save the date.  Geoff Pugh/REX/Shutterstock  Among the high-profile guests who could attend Harry and Markle's wedding at Windsor Castle are Barack and Michelle Obama, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and first lady Sophie Gregoire Trudeau and some of Markle's celebrity friends, including actress Priyanka Chopra, designer Misha Nonoo and tennis star Serena Williams.  Prince William and Princess Kate invited Ellie Goulding to perform at their wedding reception in 2011.  \"Harry has actually put on the top of his list his good friend Ed Sheeran to perform at the after-party,\" US Weekly magazine editor-in-chief Jennifer Peros told \"Good Morning America.\"  As for the bridal party, Prince William and Kate's children -- Prince George and Princess Charlotte -- will take center stage as page boy and flower girl, respectively, as they did at the 2017 wedding of their aunt, Pippa Middleton.  \"Another surprise will be Jessica Mulroney's daughter, Ivy, who I heard will be a flower girl on the day,\" Scobie said.  Who is Jessica Mulroney?  George Pimentel/Getty Images  Mulroney is Canada’s best-known stylist. She represents not only Markle but also assists Canada's first lady Sophie Gregoire Trudeau and many members of Canada’s elite.  Markle lived in Toronto during her seven-season run on the TV drama \"Suits,\" which films in the Canadian city.  Markle's much-emulated style and the so-called \"Meghan effect,\" where anything she wears quickly crashes websites and sells out, is largely because of the collaboration and vision between Mulroney and Markle.  Mulroney has been seen at Markle's side at yoga outings together and at her most important public appearances. Mulroney was invited into the private box at the closing ceremony of last year's Invictus Games alongside Markle and Harry as well as Markle's mom and her other confidante, Markus Anderson.  Mulroney also helped Markle with her look on \"Suits,\" most notably the wedding dress Markle wore as her character Rachel Zane.  USA Network  Since Markle's engagement to Harry, Mulroney has worked with the future royal to select the iconic Parosh dress and Line the Label coat Markle wore on the day the couple's engagement was announced in November. Mulroney was also at Markle's side advising her on the stunning Ralph and Russo gown and Victoria Beckham cashmere sweater Markle wore for her intimate engagement photos with Harry.  Alexi Lubomirski via AP  Alexi Lubomirski via AP  Markle's selection of outfits that are a nod to her Canadian ties and U.S. and now British roots has also come with the help of Mulroney. The nod to selecting styles from designers with local roots, often called diplomatic dressing, is also done by Princess Kate on official royal diplomatic tours.  \"One thing to really take into account is that Megan has always been very conscious of where she's going when she dresses,\" Scobie said. \"Of course we've seen her make nods to the locations she's at or the country she's in with the style choices she's made.\"  Looking ahead to Markle's wedding day, Scobie added, \"I think on the day of the wedding we'll very much see her kind of make a nod to the different places that she feels are important to her.\"  Mulroney is the wife of Ben Mulroney, whose father is a former prime minister of Canada. The couple is one of Canada's best-known power couples and are often considered Canadian royalty in Toronto.

            "text: One wouldn’t want to be in Prince William’s (dancing) shoes right now. Dubbed “throne idle” in the British press after skipping a Commonwealth Day service earlier this week in order to go skiing with friends, the 34-year-old royal is also understood to be in the dog house with his wife.  Kate is said by Royal Watch sources to be understandably “less than pleased” that her husband has been filmed partying with his friends and an unidentified woman. The new footage, which emerged Wednesday in several tabloids, shows Prince William singing and dancing with friends during a boys-only skiing trip. Shot at the popular Farinet nightclub in Verbier, the video also shows the prince putting his hand on the waist of a mystery woman  William was also filmed “dad dancing” at the club and enjoying himself on the slopes just hours before senior royals including the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince Harry attended Westminster Abbey for a Commonwealth Day service. The Queen considers the date one of the most important in the royal calendar and William’s decision not to attend was seen as significant and controversial. While the Duchess of Cambridge stayed at home with Prince George and Princess Charlotte, William, who is now back in the U.K, chose to have fun on the slopes instead of attending the service.  VIDEO: 12 Facts About Kate Middleton  “It was William’s choice to go away, but make no mistake Kate wears the trousers in their marriage, and she won’t be happy with William’s antics. She thought his partying days and larking around with the boys was a thing of the past. I imagine she’ll find this humiliating and William will have come in for a pasting,” says a source.  The couple will put on a united front when they travel to Paris for a state visit on Friday, but the ski trip has once again put the spotlight on William who has so far carried out just 13 days of royal engagements this year. The Queen, who has been in poor health, has clocked up 24 days of official duties.  Last February, the Cambridges posed on the slopes of Courchevel where they enjoyed their first family ski holiday with George and Charlotte. This year, in contrast, William opted to hit the slopes solo with a group of male friends who included Guy Pelly, James Meade, and Tom Van Straubenzee.  According to The Sun newspaper, Wills and his pals spent Sunday night dancing to the band Hussy and looked “very worse for wear” after downing “several drinks.” William, who is stepping down from his job as an air-ambulance pilot later this year, does have a history for having fun when he’s out with the boys. At Tom van Straubenzee’s wedding four years ago—which Kate had to miss because she was pregnant with Prince George—William reportedly ended up losing part of his front tooth after he was knocked in the face accidentally by his friend Tom Inskip during a marathon drinking session.  According to sources on the slopes, the champagne—and spirits—were flowing in Verbier last weekend. Wills and his friends were photographed enjoying a liquid lunch with 24-year-old Australian model Sophie Taylor who works at the Farinet nightclub and a 30-year-old British former beautician from Blackpool named Rosie Peate who they met during the vacation. The group drank British beer, wine, and Jagerbombs and seemed to be in high spirits, with the prince high-fiving Sophie Taylor at one point during the lunch. Later William and his friends met up with the girls at another posh bar where the drinking continued.  Kate, who’s not a big drinker, is apparently not the only wife said to be annoyed. Guy Pelly, whose other half, Lizzie Wilson, is about to give birth, is according to a source also “in deep trouble.”  Get Vanity Fair’s Royal Watch A weekly overview of the chatter from Kensington Palace and beyond.

            "text: Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  / Updated By Alastair Jamieson  LONDON — Meghan Markle’s father, Thomas, will not attend her wedding to Prince Harry, the bride-to-be said in a statement Thursday.  The American actress confirmed earlier media reports that her father would not be able to walk her down the aisle on Saturday. TMZ reported that he needed heart surgery.  “Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding,” she said in the statement, which was released by Kensington Palace. “I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\"  Markle, a Los Angeles native, added: “I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.”  The announcement came as a full carriage procession and military rehearsal got underway in Windsor, England, where Markle, 36, will marry Harry, 33, at St. George's Chapel.  Her mother, Doria Ragland, is still due to attend and meet her soon-to-be in-laws before the ceremony.  The American TV audience for the royal wedding is expected to exceed the 23 million Americans who tuned in for Prince William's wedding to Kate Middleton in 2011.  However, some 17 percent of Brits want to get rid of their monarchy, according to a poll.\n",

            "text: Getty  Meghan has been looking a bit peaky at the last few events.  ‘She’s usually so full of energy and very lively – but she definitely seems tired and withdrawn at the moment,’ says a source. ‘Of course, all the baby whispers would explain why she’s not herself and seems so pale.’  The exciting development comes just weeks after Meghan described being married as ‘wonderful’, before adding Harry is ‘the best husband ever’.  The news was first shared with the Queen the same day, just before Meghan boarded the train to Cheshire.  ‘It gave the Queen and Meghan a lot to talk about during their journey on the Royal Train together and there was lots of baby talk,’ reveals a source.  According to the insider, Harry has always been the Queen’s favourite and she’s taken a definite liking to Meghan – she sees a lot of herself in Meghan’s strength and tenacity.  Related: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry 'actively trying' to start a family  Related: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry reportedly 'having twins'  And to hear that they’re to be parents is exciting for Her Majesty.  ‘We haven’t seen the Queen that happy and that excited in a long time – it was wonderful to see,’ the insider revealed.  The source went on to say the mood has really continued throughout the palace since they returned. And no-one could be happier.  ‘Meghan’s still in the early stages of her pregnancy, but the palace is already working on announcements. This is the news the world has been waiting for.’  The royal couple, who are set to carry out a tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga in October, are making sure to cram in as many overseas tours as they can before Meghan is too big to travel.  ‘Harry and Meghan wanted to get a few visits in so that she could get to know the Commonwealth countries and start making a contribution to the royal family,’ revealed a source. ‘But the Queen understands that their main priority is to start a family.’  Meanwhile, royal fans in the UK have been madly placing bets on Meghan and Harry announcing their pregnancy in 2018, with Ladbrokes giving the odds a 4/6 chance.  Last month a friend close to the couple also told The Mirror: ‘They’re desperate to have a family as soon as possible’.  So keen are Harry and Meghan to have children, sources also claimed that the couple actually started trying for a baby before they got married.  Getty  Given the fact that Meghan is 36 and her biological clock is ticking, the couple didn’t want to wait to start a family.  ‘They actually stopped using protection over two months ago, although they abstained from sex in the weeks leading up to the wedding,’ a source told Hollywood Life.  And Harry previously talked about wanting kids before he even met Meghan. ‘I’ve longed for kids since I was very, very young,’ he said back in 2012.  ‘I’m waiting to find the right person. Someone who is willing to take on the job.’  In their sit-down interview with the BBC Harry expressed his desire to have children sooner rather than later: ‘We will start a family in the near future,’ he said.  Thankfully, according to royal expert Katie Nicholl, his wife is the perfect mother-to-be.  ‘Meghan is very doting with children. She is very maternal and she was thrilled to meet George and Charlotte. I think one of the lovely things that I discovered [while writing] the book was it was actually a moment involving children when Meghan really fell for Prince Harry,’ she said.

            "text: One of the more romantic scenes in Lifetime's take on everyone's favorite royal duo, Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance, involves the wedding of someone the couple is only tangentially related to: Pippa Middleton, sister of Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge. In the made-for-TV movie, the almost-royal is excluded from a pretty significant Middleton family gathering (ahem, our girl Pippa's wedding ceremony) and as it turns out, the real Meghan Markle wasn't at Pippa's wedding ceremony, either — but she managed to make it to the reception.  In the movie, the fictional Markle is on the phone with her mother, slightly sad about being left out, when Harry bursts in to take her to the party after all — where she met Harry's parents for the first time. In the film, Kate Middleton blames her sister's \"no ring, no bring\" policy — meaning only engaged or married couples were allowed — for Markle being benched. (In real life and in the movie, Markle and the prince were not yet betrothed.)  As it turns out, this plus one policy was the real deal, but as PEOPLE noted, both James Middleton's longtime girlfriend Donna Air and Princess Eugenie's longtime boyfriend Jack Brooksbank attended the ceremony. Additionally, according to The Telegraph, Markle was fully invited to Middleton's May 2017 wedding despite the \"no ring no bring\" policy, but at the last moment Markle did not appear at the ceremony itself. So what gives?  The way PEOPLE told the story, Harry left after the ceremony and drove 90 minutes back to London to pick up his then girlfriend from Kensington Palace where she was cooped up. According to Vanity Fair, Markle had been seen in London before the wedding and everything seemed good to go. E! news reported that Markle skipped out of the ceremony so as not to draw attention to a wedding that was not her own and upstage the couple on their special day. (For the record, The Daily Beast was already speculating whether or not Markle would steal the show, as many once thought Pippa did at her sister's wedding, before the big day even arrived.) It's also possible there was concern that the paparazzi, who mobbed Markle at every chance, would make for unruly and unwelcome wedding guests. The Mirror speculates that it was always the plan for Markle to attend the reception, despite laying low for the wedding itself, and that Prince Harry's last-minute drive was simply so she wouldn't have to arrive alone. (Bustle reached out to Kensington Palace for comment but did not hear back.)  courtesy of Lifetime  Unfortunately for that wasn't the end of the drama. There was still some slight scandal when The Mirror reported that Markle's black dress and white cape was a sombre fashion faux pas for a wedding reception. The Lifetime movie leaves this bit out, making Markle's reception dress red, and any real life faux pas doesn't seem to have affected any permanent damage on Markle's relationship with the Royals in 2018.  Oh, but there's more: The wedding reception scene in the Lifetime movie takes additional steps to mix fiction with reality for the sake of drama by including a fictional relative named Lady Violet, who wears an offensive brooch to the wedding. The scene calls to mind a heated racist brooch trolling debacle — in which Princess Michael of Kent caught fire for wearing a blackamoor brooch, with an exotic and offensive depiction of an African person, to a luncheon attended by Markle. The Princess later apologized and claimed not to have worn something so offensive to Markle intentionally, but in the Lifetime movie, Harry warns this fictional Lady Violet about the same brooch, months before the luncheon would have taken place — which is a pretty shady twist on the real life story.  And look, there was probably a decent amount of actual family drama at Pippa's wedding — the Royals are humans, after all, and humans get dramatic at weddings. But clearly, the Lifetime movie plays up it all up for our amusement — likely far more than anything that actually happened in real life.\n",

            "text: Celebrity conspiracy theories: Kate Middleton's 'surrogate pregnancy' to Marilyn Monroe's overdose by Kayleigh Dray | 07 04 2016 Celebrity conspiracy theories © WENN / REX / YOUTUBE Conspiracy theorists, rejoice!  From Beyonce's fake baby bump to Marilyn Monroe's murder, we've taken a look back over the most enduring celebrity conspiracy theories of all time. Read on for more...  Kate Middleton did NOT give birth to a baby girl  Yeah, you read that right; some people out there have convinced themselves that the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to Princess Charlotte via a surrogate mother.  Why? Well, for no real reason other than the fact that she looked so good when she appeared outside the Lindo Wing of London's St Mary's Hospital with Princess Charlotte on 2nd May 2015.  One conspiracy theorist, who was quoted in a Russian newspaper, said: “It was a surrogate mother who gave birth but not her. Kate must have been wearing a fake belly showing to the people that she was pregnant. Another added to the Komsomolskaya Pravda: “She did not give birth, I am sure. There is no special maternal look in her eyes - this natural thing is not visible.”  This theory is, quite obviously, nonsense; the Duchess of Cambridge was just lucky enough to have a team of stylists on hand after Princess Charlotte’s arrival – hence the amazing hair, makeup, and coordinating mother-and-baby ensemble.  And the thing about the eyes? Utterly bizarre; all you need to do is look at Kate to see just how much she loves her little girl.  Beyonce is actually Solange's mum  Apparently Beyoncé wasn’t actually born in 1981; yup, someone who claims to work for the Department of Health in Texas supposedly unearthed her birth certificate and claims it has her birth date as 1974.  Gabrielle Union, who was born in 1972, also famously said that she and Queen B were BFFs when they were teenagers - again suggesting that she's a tad older than she says she is.  Cue people claiming that Beyonce got pregnant at around 12 or 13-years-old, had a baby girl, and her family covered it up by pretending Solange was actually Matthew and Tina's daughter.  COULD IT BE?!?!  Probably not; it sounds too much like an EastEnders storyline to us. Also, y'know, there are pictures and videos of them together as children. Children who are THE SAME AGE.  Nicolas Cage is a vampire  There's a photo of a man from the Civil War circulating the interweb, and, yes, it looks a lot like Nicolas Cage.  This has led people to claim that (it pains us to write this) the actor is, in fact, a vampire - and he reinvents himself every 75 years or so. facepalm  Brittany Murphy was murdered by the government  Brittany Murphy died on 20th December 2009 at the age of 32 after suffering a reported cardiac arrest. At the time of her death, the Los Angeles coroner said he believed the cause of death \"appears to be natural\", later stating that it was an accident spurred by medications she was taking to combat pneumonia and an iron deficiency.  But, when her husband, Simon Monjack, died five months later, in similar circumstances to Brittany, her father grew suspicious. Angelo Betolotti obtained hair, blood and tissue samples for independent testing - and they have reportedly revealed the presence of ten separate heavy metals in Brittany's system.  At the time of her death, Brittany reportedly displayed all the symptoms of heavy metal poisoning, including headaches, dizziness, abdominal cramps, coughing, sweating, disorientation, wheezing, congestion and pneumonia.  In a recent interview with Fleur De Lis Film Studios, Brittany's father claimed that his daughter was under surveillance after speaking out in support of Julia Davis, a government whistleblower: \"They were, in fact, under surveillance, including helicopters. Their telephones were wiretapped.  “Vicious rumours, spread by tabloids, unfairly smeared Brittany’s reputation. My daughter was neither anorexic nor a drug junkie, as they repeatedly implied. \"Brittany and Simon were ridiculed […] when they complained of being under surveillance and in fear for their lives. I will not rest until the truth about these tragic events is told. There will be justice for Brittany.”  Do you think there is more to her death than meets the eye?  Tom Cruise hired Katie Holmes to be his wife  As far-fetched as it sounds, plenty of people out there believe that Tom Cruise approached several young Hollywood stars (including Scarlett Johansson) with an offer of a five-year marriage contract.  In exchange for marrying Cruise, the bride would receive a career boost and cash, plus a bonus if she gave birth to a child. For Tom, the marriage would provide him with a child, rehabilitate his increasingly eccentric public image, and finally quash all of those pesky gay rumors.  However sources close to the couple (whom are now divorced) have poured water on the rumours, insisting Cruise was \"completely in love with Katie\".  Plus there's the fact that Katie demanded sole custody of daughter Suri in her divorce filing; surely any pre-existing contract between her and Cruise would have prevented her from doing any such thing?  James Hewitt is Prince Harry's real dad  Hmm. Basically, James Hewitt claimed he had an affair with Princess Diana from 1986 - 1991, and, as he looks a lot like Harry, a lot of people have said he MUST be the prince's real dad.  Harry, being the jokester he is, has never taken the reports seriously - and has even cracked a joke about it. During a visit to Bacon’s College in South East London with William and Kate in July 2012, a young boy shouted across the football field to Wills: “Are you two brothers?”  Quick-witted Harry instantly replied: “We’re not sure.” Oh Hazzer, we love you so.  Marilyn Monroe was murdered  Marilyn Monroe's death remains a mystery, even today, although there is a LOT of evidence to suggest that she was murdered. And we don't say things like that lightly...  While empty pill bottles were found in her room, the room contained no means to wash the pills down (there was no glass and the water was turned off). T  he pathologist, Dr. Thomas Noguchi, could find no trace of capsules, powder or the typical discolouration caused by Nembutal in Monroe's stomach or intestines, indicating that the drugs that killed her had not been swallowed. T  he time of death and witness statements do not match up, phone records have suspiciously gone missing and police claim that Marilyn's housekeeper had changed the sheets - was even washing sheets - when they arrived.  But if it wasn't suicide, who killed her?  In October 2006, under the Freedom of Information Act, the FBI released thousands of classified documents, including a three-page report about Marilyn Monroe.  It detailed Marilyn's affairs with John F. Kennedy, claiming that he had promised to divorce his wife and marry her. But, when Marilyn found out he had no intention of doing so, she threatened to go public with their affair. W  hen you add the contents of this file to the MANY discrepancies in the evidence surrounding Marilyn's death, you can see why so many conspiracy theorists are adamant that Marilyn was murdered.  Khloe Kardashian's dad is OJ Simpson  Khloe Kardashian's stepmother famously claimed that the reality star is not Robert Kardashian's biological daughter.  And, in 2013, OJ Simpson's manager has added fuel to the flames, stating that Khloe \"could be OJ's kid\".  \"It's all going to come out sooner or later,\" Norman Pardo told In Touch Weekly in a new interview about her paternity.  OJ, who’s currently serving a 9-to 33-year sentence in a Nevada prison for kidnapping and armed robbery, hasn't denied that Khloé could be his daughter. “Whenever I bring it up, he giggles.”  Kris and O.J. were close friends before Robert, an attorney, successfully defended the NFL star against charges he’d murdered his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, who was also one of Kris’ dearest friends.  “They all took their vacations together. There was a lot of partying going on back then.\"  We doubt Khloe will be too perturbed by the claims.  In fact, she resisted having a DNA test last year, telling Kris Jenner in her typically blunt and hilarious manner: “My dad is Robert Kardashian. My other dad is Bruce Jenner. \"If you f**ked other people during the same time, and you do not know, go on Maury. Like, I don’t care!”  Pippa Middleton wore a fake bum to the royal wedding  It's not so much a hit below the belt as it is a hit below the skirt, is it?  Yup, Mr Bern, a Knight of the Order of Grimaldi in Monaco and an expert on etiquette, claimed last year that the bum which enchanted the world was, in fact, a false.  He said: “But of course she had a false bottom. I repeat it,she had a false bottom. “You take her away from that and she has normal buttocks. It was an optical illusion.  “She knew there were a billion people watching. It was the moment to show it.”  Sounds a pretty bum theory to us - Pippa's shapely derriere couldn't possibly have been faked!  Michael Jackson was chemically castrated  Michael Jackson had a truly amazing voice - but some have claimed that his ability to reach those high notes was all down to chemical castration.  Alain Branchereau, a professor of vascular surgery, insisted that MJ used the synthetic anti-male hormone drug Cyproterone as a cure for his acne.  He said: \"When he was 12, Michael Jackson had acne. We know this, he spoke about it himself as a tragedy.  \"What I think could have happened is that his people suggested this miracle treatment.\"  He explained that the drug \"blocks puberty, the voice can't mature,\" stops bodily hair and the larynx from growing, and affects the bones, leaving the body with a slight frame and a large chest. When the treatment is finished, the patient \"keeps a child's larynx all his life in a man's body.\"  We will never have proof as to whether or not this is true, but the rumour makes us feel desperately sad.  Paul McCartney died in a car crash- and was replaced by a lookalike  Yeah, you heard us.  A lot of obsessive Beatles fans are CONVINCED that Sir Paul is an impostor and that the real deal was decapitated and burnt to a crisp in a car crash.  Hmm.  Because of all the buckets of money the Beatles contributed to England's tax coffers, their continued success was vital to the financial health of the nation. So the British government, in cahoots with the surviving members of the Beatles, conspired to cover-up Paul's death.  Apparently the evidence we need to believe this theory can be found on the cover of the Beatles' last album, Abbey Road.  Which was, apparently, a way for the other Beatles to confess and alleviate their guilt over the whole body swap thing. The image shows the fab four crossing the road, with Lennon in white (the preacher), Starr in black (the undertaker), \"McCartney\" in a suit and barefoot (the corpse) and Harrison in blue jeans and work shirt (the grave digger).  Paul is out of step with the other boys, suggesting he's not an original bug. Sir Paul, in an interview with Life, has since explained that \"On Abbey Road we were wearing our ordinary clothes. I was walking barefoot because it was a hot day. The Volkswagen just happened to be parked there.\"  But the theorists refuse to believe him. Well, they wouldn't, would they? NOBODY BELIEVES FAKE PAUL!  Beyonce faked her pregnancy  Forget the Solange theory; remember how everyone decided that Beyonce faked her pregnancy? Yeah.  It was all based on a moment when Queen Bee sat down for an interview with Molly Meldrum in Australia and her pregnant belly appeared to… well, deflate.  In a strange way.  And she was spotted pulling an \"oops\" face just after it happened, if you believe the extremely slowed-down versions of the moment on YouTube.  Whatever.  We label this one SERIOUSLY far-fetched, but, to all the disbelievers out there, it's safe to say that Bey is a pretty awesome mum to Blue Ivy. Surrogate or not.  Miley Cyrus died in 2010 and was replaced by a lookalike  Yup, just like Paul McCartney. Duh!  Apparently Miley's body was found in the desert way back in 2010 and was replaced by another Disney star, who got plastic surgery to look like her.  You can check out all of the (very flimsy and ludicrous) 'evidence' for the far-fetched theory here  What do you think?  Elvis Presley faked his own death  Elvis may have left the building, but plenty of people are still debating over which route he took.  Yup, there's a persistent belief that \"the King\" did NOT die in 1977, he simply faked his own death.  Sigh.  Elvis was, according to theorists, a prisoner of his own fame. He couldn't go anywhere without being recognised and was forced to experiment with wigs and glasses in a bid to go about his everyday life undetected.  But things got… well, they got too much. He decided to fake his death, say goodbye to Elvis Presley and live out his last years in peace and solitude.  Apparently Elvis, much like Shakespeare's Romeo, knew which drugs he could self-administer to create a deathlike state. His extensive experience with the martial arts and yoga was such that he could slow his heart rate and breathing in order to feign death.  And he was no stranger to using a fake name; government documents report that Elvis used the name John Burrows as an alias when he wanted to travel incognito.  Throw in hundreds of rumoured sightings, a seriously speedy funeral (it happened ONE DAY after the King checked out), a mysterious black helicopter floating around Graceland, an elderly man named Jesse who was snapped hanging out with Lisa Marie's son (his grandson) and a rumoured wax body double in the open casket and you have a recipe for a good ol' fashioned conspiracy theory. A  lthough we have a feeling a lot of people were so desperate to believe this theory that they couldn't help but find \"evidence\" to support it.  Whatever. Long live the King, we guess!  Keanu Reeves is immortal  If you want to see the proof for this theory, it's here - but we can summarise it for you.  Basically, Keanu Reeves looks young. His face has barely a wrinkle upon it since he burst onto our screens way back when - and, after someone found a portrait of Charlemagne, little minds started working in overtime.  They write: \"Aside from the striking resemblance, the account of the death of Charlemagne rise suspicion.  \"First of all he crowned his son just before dying (just like he knew he was going to 'die') secondly his burial was rushed during cold weather this is a clear hint that they needed to bury a body to not rise any suspicion.\"  They then go on to find a number of people throughout history who look an awful lot like Keanu Reeves (in the sense that they are also humans with dark hair and eyes), and insist this is proof the actor has 'everlasting life'. This is why, they say, he is so generous in his charitable donations; he has plenty of money leftover from his long old life.  We dispute this theory, naturally; anyone else think Keanu just uses a really good moisturiser?  Kurt Cobain was murdered  The Nirvana singer was found dead at his home in Seattle on April 8, 1994.  It seemed an open and shut case; the singer - who had disappeared from a drug rehabilitation clinic - had, according to his wife, Courtney Love, been suicidal and a suicide note was found.  The initial police report stated that Cobain had been found with a shotgun across his chest and an autopsy ruled that he had died by a single gunshot wound to the head and that he had taken a large amount of heroin.  However, Tom Grant, a private investigator hired by Love to find Cobain after he disappeared from the clinic, believed that the singer was murdered.  He claimed that the amount of heroin in Cobain's bloodstream would have made it impossible for him to have put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. Grant insists an unknown assassin administered the drug and then shot Cobain.  But what about that suicide note?  Well, Grant believed that the supposed \"suicide\" note was actually a letter announcing Kurt's plans to leave Courtney Love and the music business and that references to suicide had been added later.  But who would have wanted Kurt dead? We just don't buy this one.  John Lennon was killed by the US government  The former Beatle was shot dead outside the Dakota building in New York where he lived by Mark David Chapman on December 8, 1980. Chapman was jailed for murder and is still in prison.  Case closed, right? Wrong.  Obviously.  Conspiracy theories, unable to let it go, have claimed that Chapman was programmed by US government agents to kill Lennon - and that they used the novel Catcher in the Rye as a signal to go ahead with the operation.  But why on earth would the government want to kill John Lennon? It just doesn't make any sense.  Bruce Lee kicked his way out of his coffin  Martial arts legend Bruce Lee was pronounced dead at the tender age of 32, due to swelling of the brain.  But, being so young and healthy, people immediately became sceptical.  And, after Bruce's coffin lid had to be replaced, many assumed he'd kicked it off and escaped to live a better life.  Where?  In Brussels.  Hey, don't blame us - we don't come up with these ideas!  North West is the antichrist  Kim Kardashian and Kanye West welcomed their first child into the world on June 15, 2013 - quite a bit earlier than her original due date.  This could have been down to Kim's pre-eclampsia, but that, for many people, was too logical a suggestion. Instead, they've decided it's because North West is the antichrist.  Yup, you read that right; the antichrist.  It has been suggested that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were desperate to have their child on 15th June, 2013.  That’s 15/6/2013 in numeric form.  Check it out: (1+5)=6, 6, 2+0+1+3=6Ergo, 6/15/2013 = 666 - the number of the devil.  SIGH - someone spent a lot of time trying to make those numbers work.  Poor little Nori, eh?  Tupac is alive and well and living in Cuba  Tupac tragically died on 13th September 1996, after being shot as he rode in a car driven by Death Row Records chairman \"Suge\" Knight near the Las Vegas strip in September 1996. But plenty of his fans refuse to believe it.  Why? Well, there's the fact he was cremated the day after his death - there's no body for fans to dig up and examine as 'proof.  The rest of their 'evidence' is pretty shady.  Apparently Tupac staged his own death and fled to Cuba to live out his years in peace with his godmother Assata Shakur.  Following an Eminem reference to Pac’s Cuban refuge and the addition of Pac’s godmother to the F.B.I.’s most wanted list, threads began to pop up on forums alluding that he would return from Cuba in 2014.  Plus there's the hologram performance, which some conspiracy theorists have decided was actually the real Tupac.  And there's all those 'sightings' of Tupac around the world, lurking in the backgrounds of photographs and videos.  Hmm. We're not convinced - are you?  Buddy Holly escaped the Bermuda Triangle  Buddy Holly is a bit of a mystery, mainly because his death is connected to the ultra-mysterious Bermuda Triangle.  Yup, we swear it; the singer’s plane disappeared somewhere over that eerie stretch of water - and now plenty of YouTubers have claimed he's alive and well and living in Ganamede.  Hmm. As long as his music continues to be played, he can live on wherever, surely?  John F. Kennedy was assassinated by the CIA  Everyone has a theory on who killed JFK but, for most, the idea that the CIA was behind the assassination of the president is just too… well, too hard to disprove.  First, the facts: On 22nd November 1963, President Kennedy was riding in a motorcade in Dallas, Texas, when he was shot and killed.  Roughly one hour later, Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for Kennedy's murder; however, Oswald was not in custody long before he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby.  Next, the conspiracy theory: Most theorists do not believe Oswald was responsible for Kennedy's murder, while those that do believe he had help - after all, he was firing an ancient rifle from VERY far away.  And hitting a small moving target from such a distance, in wind, would be difficult.  Footage of the event taken by Abraham Zapruder supported the growing belief that at least four shots were fired - not the three that the Warren Commission claimed. The moments of impact recorded on the film also suggested that at least one of the shots came from a completely different direction to those supposedly fired by Oswald - evidence backed up by testimony of several eye witnesses.  Many believed that several shots were fired by gunmen hiding behind a picket fence on a grassy knoll overlooking the plaza.  There is an enduring theory that the CIA, furious over rumours that JFK was about to \"splinter the CIA into a thousand peaces\", staged the assassination.  And, whether the shots were fired by the \"three tramps\" spotted at the scene of the crime, the agent who fired wildly in JFK's direction from the car behind or a lone sniper on the grassy knoll, it goes without saying that this is a theory that won't be going away any time soon.  Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Suri & Scientology  Speaking in her explosive new exposé “Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology”, Leah Remini has claimed that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes left their daughter Suri (at the time 7 months old) to cry on a bathroom floor at their wedding.  After five minutes of listening to Suri’s cries, Leah claims she went to check on the baby and found Cruise’s sister, his assistant and another woman staring at her as though she was ‘L Ron Hubbard incarnate’, a rebirth of the religion’s founder.  The actress claims that she finally convinced the women in the bathroom to pick up the crying baby and give her a bottle of warm milk.  The Church of Scientology, which released a response to Remini on its website, stated of her claims about the wedding: \"Every claim Ms. Remini has made is not only untrue, but ridiculous and stupid. She is just trying to latch onto a prominent celebrity for her own publicity.  “As a note, every guest but Ms. Remini respected the couple’s privacy by not speaking about it afterward. That in itself describes what kind of person Ms. Remini is: self-absorbed, rude and embarrassing, all traits she displayed as a guest of this event according to parishioners who attended.\"\n",

            "text: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding cake has finally been unveiled—and it's one gorgeous dessert! London-based baker Claire Ptak and her team created a lemon elderflower cake for Harry and Meghan's wedding's reception.  Kensington Palace first shared the wedding cake plans back in March, revealing that Ptak, who was raised in California and now owns Violet Cakes in London, was selected to bake it. Many were surprised that the couple chose a lemon elderflower cake for their Windsor Castle reception, since most royal wedding cakes are traditionally fruit cake. But Harry and Meghan broke from tradition to choose a spring-inspired cake covered in buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.  See the cake from every angle here:  A full look at the cake on display. Getty Images  Getty Images  A close-up look at the fresh flowers on top. Getty Images  A day before the wedding, the Palace shared photos and a video of Ptak's team working on the cake in the Buckingham Palace kitchen. Even though they are baking and icing the cake at the Palace, Ptak revealed her team will assemble the cake at Windsor Castle on Saturday morning.  See the full video, including details on the cake recipe, below:  🎥 Watch as baker Claire Ptak begins work on the #RoyalWedding Cake! pic.twitter.com/OTdcF9hc0a — The Royal Family (@RoyalFamily) May 18, 2018  This isn't the first royal wedding cake preview fans have received so far. A few days ago, Ptak posted a photo of lemon crates on her Instagram along with the caption \"And so it begins 🍋\"  According to the Kensington Palace Twitter account, Ptak \"focuses on using seasonal and organic ingredients in her cakes.\" It was also revealed that Markle had previously interviewed Chef Ptak on The Tig.  \"Pastry Chef Claire Ptak has hit the nail on the head with her London bakery serving up delightful treats that have garnered a cult following (in that ever so civilized British way) in the UK and beyond,\" Markle wrote on her now-shuttered lifestyle site back in 2015.  Prince Harry and Ms. Markle have asked Claire to create a lemon elderflower cake that will incorporate the bright flavours of spring. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers. — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) March 20, 2018  Prince Harry and Ms. Markle are looking forward to sharing the cake with guests at their wedding at Windsor Castle on May 19th. — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) March 20, 2018  Earlier this year, Ptak shared the happy news on her Instagram as well.  \"Kinda excited to announce this one!!\" she teased in the caption. \"Violet has been chosen to make the wedding cake for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. @kensingtonroyal They both share so many of the same values regarding food provenance, sustainability, seasonality and of course, flavour! Xxx\"    Unlike American wedding cakes, the top tier of British wedding cakes is traditionally what we think of as a Christmas-style fruit cake, so it will last long enough to be served at the couple's first child's christening, making the lemon elderflower cake something of a departure from the norm. At their reception in 2011, Will and Kate served a groom's cake made of chocolate biscuits in addition to a traditional eight-tiered wedding cake.\n",

            "text: Update, 12:45 p.m.: Royal reporter Rebecca English clarified that the empty chair at the wedding wasn't a tribute to Princess Diana. Instead, it's protocol to leave the seat in front of the Queen empty.  Btw - I’ve seen some reports about the spare seat by Prince William in the chapel as having being left in memory of Princess Diana. It wasn’t empty for that reason. The seat in front of the Queen is always left empty, I am told by BP #royalwedding — Rebecca English (@RE_DailyMail) May 19, 2018  But even with the vacant chair aside, there were plenty of tributes to Princess Diana at the nuptials, including Meghan Markle's veil, her bridal bouquet, the floral arrangements, and the reading from Lady Jane Fellowes, Diana's sister.  Original post, 11:38 a.m.: About 600 guests filled St. George's Chapel for the royal wedding today, but one seat was apparently left vacant—and it's believed to be for Princess Diana. While following along with the nuptials, viewers noticed there was an empty seat next to Prince William on the royal family's side of the congregation. The supposed explanation? It was reserved for Prince Harry's late mother.    Getty Images  Royal fans got emotional over the tribute.

An empty seat for Princess Diana? #RoyalWedding — Lauren Jones White (@LaurenJo8) May 19, 2018  Aside from the empty chair, the royal nuptials was laden with special nods to the late princess, who passed away in 1997. All three of her siblings were present at today's ceremony, and her sister Lady Jane Fellowes gave a reading.  The white roses in the floral arrangements were also included in honor of Harry's mom. He reportedly hand-picked Meghan's bouquet of forget-me-nots, his mother's favorite flower. Markle gave a sweet shoutout with her veil, which was reminiscent of Diana's insanely long \"monarch-length\" headpiece for her 1981 wedding to Prince Charles in 1981.  To top it off, Sir Elton John, a longtime friend of Diana, performed at the lunchtime reception  There was also apparently an empty chair left at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in Westminster Abbey seven years ago. Viewers at the time also speculated on Twitter that it was a nod to the groom's late mother.  Who's sitting in that empty chair to Camilla's left?

Gone but never forgotten. #royalwedding — Donnie Dhillon (@DonnieDhillon) April 29, 2011  Prince William and Kate Middleton paid tribute to Diana in various ways on their wedding day in 2011. First and foremost, the Duke gave his bride his mother's engagement ring. They also visited her grave before their wedding day. The address was given by the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres, who knew Diana and spoke at her 10th anniversary memorial, Reuters reports. Finally, the hymn \"Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer,\" which was sung at the late princess' funeral, was also included in her son's royal wedding.\n",

            "text: IT certainly says a lot about Meghan Markle’s confidence that she’s allowed her fiancé Prince Harry to invite ex-girlfriends to his wedding.  We previously told how Cressida Bonas, who dated the young royal for two years between 2012 and 2014, had got the call-up.  AP:Associated Press 10 Meghan may have won Prince Harry's heart, but who else came close?  However, this week it has been reported that Zimbabwean beauty Chelsy Davy, who had an on-off six-year relationship with the prince, has been snubbed from the wedding reception.  So, which of his other glamorous exes have made the cut – and who is Not Formally Invited?  Ellie Goulding - INVITED  Getty Images - Getty 10 Ellie Goulding was spotted canoodling with Harry at the Audi Polo Challenge in May 2016  Prince Harry is believed to have dated the 31-year-old singer after the pair were spotted canoodling at the Audi Polo Challenge in May 2016.  The couple, who have been pals since meeting at Prince William’s wedding in 2011, are said to have exchanged some flirty text messages.  At the time, a source close to Harry’s circle told The Sun: “He has told friends how much he likes Ellie and she is clearly taken by him.”  In March we revealed that Ellie has been invited to the nuptials on May 19 - seven years after she sang at the wedding reception of Harry’s brother William in Buckingham Palace.  Camilla Thurlow - NFI  Getty - Contributor 10 Love Island star Camilla is rumoured to have snogged Harry - but is now dating reality show co-star Jamie Jewitt  The Love Island star, 27, is rumoured to have dated Harry following his split from Cressida Bonas in 2014, having been spotted snogging him in Tonteria nightclub in Chelsea.  She managed to stay pretty tight-lipped about it on the reality show last year, claiming \"a lady never tells\" when quizzed during a game of Truth or Dare.  Like Meghan, Camilla is an eager charity worker, having worked for the Halo Trust - the mine-clearance charity whose work was promoted by Princess Diana - and has described the actress as \"amazing and beautiful\".  We can imagine the two women being bezzie mates - but sadly, as far as we know, Camilla isn't on the guestlist.    Caroline Flack - NFI  Rex Features 10 Caroline is now engaged - but was previously linked to Harry  Caroline's been busy in her own love life of late, getting engaged to Apprentice star Andrew Brady after just three months of dating.  The 38-year-old dated Prince Harry in 2009, while she was a host on Gladiators.  Speaking about her brief romance with the prince, Caroline said: \"‘Once the story got out, that was it. We had to stop seeing each other.  \"I was no longer Caroline Flack, TV presenter, I was Caroline Flack, Prince Harry’s bit of rough.\"  With Love Island returning to our screens in the coming months, we imagine Caroline might be \"too busy\" even if she did land an invite...  Chelsy Davy - NFI  Rex Features 10 Chelsy was Prince Harry's first love, after meeting through mutual pals in 2004  Chelsy, 32, returned to Africa to study while Harry focused on his army career and Royal duties.  Chelsy was Prince Harry's first love, after meeting through mutual pals in 2004She returned to the UK to take up a top job at a law firm and was seen accompanying Harry to a number of high-brow events, including his brother's wedding to Kate Middleton.  Getty - Contributor 10 Chelsy is said to be 'a little hurt' to be missed off the reception guest list  Though that year brought an end to their romance, yet party animal Chelsy and Harry remain good friends.  If reports are to be believed, she hasn't been asked to Harry's evening do at Frogmore House, and is \"surprised\", \"shocked\" and \"a little hurt\".  Cressida Bonas - INVITED  Getty - Contributor 10 Cressida and Harry tried to keep their relationship relatively private  Model and actress Cressida, 28, was introduced to Harry by his cousin Princess Eugenie.  The pair shared a lust for life but still managed to keep their relationship relatively private, apart from moments when they were snapped off holidaying or partying at Glasto.  She allegedly called off their romance due to struggling with life in the spotlight while engagement rumours swirled, but the pair have remained on good terms.  Eugenie is also still pals with Cressy, and has invited her to her autumn wedding.  We can't imagine she'll recycle her frock from Harry's big day...  She is now dating chartered surveyor Harry Wentworth-Stanley, and posted a loved-up snap on Instagram on his 29th birthday, describing him as \"my love\". Could wedding bells be on the cards for her, too?  Splash News 10 Cressida has apparently been invited to the wedding  Florence Brudenell-Bruce - NFI  Getty - Contributor 10 Lingerie model Florence Brudenell-Bruce was spotted on Harry’s arm in 2011  Lingerie model Florence Brudenell-Bruce, 32, was spotted on Harry’s arm in 2011, shortly after his split from Chelsy Davy.  She went on to marry multi-millionaire Henry St George in a romantic ceremony in the south of France, though her and the prince remain pals.  So, has she been invited? Well, she currently lives in the Bahamas and has a three-year-old to look after, so we'd say it's pretty unlikely she'll be there on the big day.    Mollie King - NFI  Getty Images - Getty 10 Mollie caught Harry's eye in 2012 and the pair enjoyed a string of dates  The Saturdays singer caught Harry's eye in 2012 and the pair enjoyed a string of dates.

            "text: Prince Harry's net worth is 8-figures. Chris Jackson - WPA Pool/Getty Images  Megan Markle will be marrying into class, status, and major wealth when she ties the royal knot with Prince Harry on May 19.  Before she moved across the pond, Markle was earning close to half a million dollars a year starring in the USA Network drama \"Suits,\" plus a five-figure income from endorsement deals and sponsorships. Her total net worth is estimated to be $5 million.  That's a sizable contribution to bring into any marriage, but when she marries Prince Harry, their combined net worth will be more than five times that. Prince Harry's net worth is at least $25 million (£18 million) and as much as $40 million (£28.7 million), according to estimates from Wealth-X.  Here's where all that money comes from.  Along with Prince William and Kate Middleton, Harry receives an annual seven-figure allowance from his father and heir to the throne, Prince Charles, which is used to cover expenses like travel and wardrobe. Between April 2016 and March 2017, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Harry split nearly $5 million (£3.5 million) in allowance from their father, according to an annual review released by Clarence House.  Prince Charles derives that money, in part, from a private estate called the Duchy of Cornwall, which has funded the royal family's public and private lives for nearly 700 years. The estate provided a total of $28.8 million (£20.7 million), including Harry and William's allowance, to Prince Charles and his wife Camilla between 2016 and 2017.  Chris Jackson/Getty  Since age 21, Harry and William have also been receiving a $450,000 a year investment profit from Princess Diana's estate, which they pay taxes on to the UK government. They received a sizeable inheritance from their late mother estimated to be around $10 million each, which each prince gained access to on his 30th birthday. Plus, during his 10 years in the British Royal Air Force, Harry earned an annual income of $50,000.  Despite a massive fortune, Markle and Harry reportedly will not sign a prenuptial agreement before their wedding, reported Business Insider's Shana Lebowtiz.  A prenup is a smart choice for most couples who have sizable assets they want to protect in the event of a divorce, but for Harry — and William, who chose to forgo a prenup with Middleton — it doesn't make much sense. The princes likely don't have much property of their own, as the most valuable national treasures like the Crown Jewels or the Tower of London are part of the royal collection held by the Queen.  Still, the merging of Harry and Markle's finances could \"cause tax headaches\" and create some \"mundane hurdles\" for the royal family, as The Washington Post first reported in November.  Markle is a citizen of the US and is purportedly living in the UK on a family visa, according to the BBC. If she eventually becomes a dual US-UK citizen, Markle will have to continue filing her taxes each year with the IRS. If she has more than $300,000 in assets at any point during the year, she will have to file a specific form that details foreign assets, which could include foreign trusts, subjecting the royal family \"to outside scrutiny,\" according to the Post. But ultimately there are a lot of factors that come into play.  Eddie Mulholland/AP  \"The key for Meghan and her advisors would be to figure out what type of income she will be getting,\" Avani Ramnani, director of financial planning and wealth management at Francis Financial, told Business Insider. \"Will this income be from the investments of a trust, or 'wages' for any work that she does, or any other type of income? Sometimes, getting one form of income is more advantageous than another.\"  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding — aside from Markle's dress — which is expected to cost the royal family upwards of $45 million (£32 million), most of which is allotted for security.  That won't be a huge cost burden for Queen Elizabeth, who is of course the wealthiest member of the royal family with an estimated net worth of $530 million as of 2016, according to Forbes.

            "text: When newlyweds Prince Harry and Meghan Markle cozy up to each other, NBD, but when Kate Middleton tapped the knee of Prince William — her husband of nearly seven years — during an interview in December, the moment was internationally scrutinized. At the royal wedding of the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Kate and William took special interest in each other, going so far as to lean over poor Camilla to converse:    Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Prince William, Camila, and Kate Middleton in the pews of St George’s Chapel at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s May 19, 2018 wedding. Getty Images  Although body language typically reflects a couple's emotional connection, you can't fully interpret it without context — particularly when observing how a royal couple behaves in public, according to body language expert Blanca Cobb based in North Carolina. \"They may be more reserved [than other couples] in their public displays of affection, but that doesn’t meant they love each other any less or aren’t excited about each other,\" Cobb says.  To better understand what *really* goes on behind palace doors, Cobb analyzed a handful of the couple's closest public encounters:  1. When Kate Leans Over Camilla  Getty Images  In the midst of a royal wedding, there's no such thing as a private moment — but boy do William and Kate try! Above, they attempt to converse, leaning forward to make eye contact without overstepping into Camilla's personal space, Cobb observes. \"William and Kate prefer to be together and share moments privately,\" she says. So much for seating charts!  2. When Kate Tapped William's Knee  Kate taps William’s knee during a filmed interview. (December 2017)  Despite the recent hoopla surrounding this exchange, it isn't *really* about affection or romance, according to Cobb, who sees tapping as a way to signal, \"Hey, we can both relate,\" in lighthearted situations. That said, touching doesn't necessarily happen between any two people: \"There's a level of familiarity, comfort, and likability in touch. Through touch you connect with your partner. You let them know that they’re important to you,\" Cobb says. \"Gentle touches, playful moments, and sincere smiles show that they enjoy each other’s company and have fun together.\"  3. When They Walked Arm-in-Arm  The couple walks together after a rowing race in Germany. (July 2017) Samir Hussein/ Getty Images  Cobb says couples who synchronize their movements are emotionally in sync, and in the photo above, Kate and William both lead with their left legs. \"This shows they are in tune with each other,\" Cobb says. Because Kate walks slightly ahead of William in this photo, it's a sign that she may be a dominant force in their relationship, according to Cobb.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  4. When They Stood in the Stands  The couple holds horns while watching the London Marathon. (April 2017) Samir Hussein / Getty Images  \"Body mirroring is another sign you’re really digging your partner,\" Cobb says, pointing out the way Kate and William both lean toward their left, and they both rest their left forearms on the railing.  5. When William Wrapped His Arms Around Kate  William embraces Kate during London 2012 Olympic Games. (August 2012) Pascal Le Segretain / Getty Images  \"You can get a temperature reading of how hot a couple is for one another by their physical proximity and the level of touch,\" Cobb says. Although this doesn't appear to be an intimate moment, since Kate and William aren't locking eyes, \"they’re seizing the moment with physical closeness that brings them closer emotionally,\" Cobb says.  6. When Kate Draped Her Arms Around William  The couple embraces during the London 2012 Olympic Games. (August 2012) Pascal Le Segretain / Getty Images  Cobb isn't concerned that the couples' eyes don't meet during this embrace, since they're watching a sports game. \"Her hands are relaxed on his shoulders, they're standing body-to-body with no air between them, and while his hands fall away from her a little, his fingers look relaxed with no tightness,\" Cobb says. \"They are very relaxed and comfortable expressing themselves the best way they can, as royals.\"  Cobb thinks nothing of the way Kate is tilting her hips away from William in the photo above, in part because it's difficult to determine how much room Kate had to shift around in the stands. And because Kate and William tend to act demure around each other, facing each other, hip-to-hip, would seem out of character for them, anyway.  7. When Kate Air Kisses William  Kate kisses William on both cheeks after his polo team wins a competition (July 2011). Samir Hussein / Getty Images  Kate and William rarely kiss in public, and this cheek kiss would be a rare exception — except that Kate doesn't actually touch her lips to William's face. \"You can't say she doesn't feel emotion for her husband,\" Cobb says. \"There's still no tension here. Kate is reaching out to him, has a relaxed bend in her arm, with her fingers relaxed on shoulder.\"  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  William, on the other hand, looks less comfortable receiving affection in this context. \"He's body blocking by holding the gift between them,\" Cobb says, although this doesn't mean these partners don't show fondness toward each other. \"It could be that this is the extent of affection they're willing to demonstrate in public.\"  8. When They Were Young  The couple poses for photo on the day of their university graduation.

He's most likely holding Kate's hand in place — a sign of mutual comfort.\"  9. When Kate and William Lean In  The couple sits side by side during a graduation ceremony.

When William Touched Kate's Lower Back  The couple attends media event.

When The Newly Marrieds Kissed On The Buckingham Palace Balcony  The couple kisses on their wedding day. (April 2011)  Cobb says the couple's wedding kiss is the least intimate interaction of them all. \"It was their wedding day! They should have been touching and embracing heart-to-heart,\" she says. Instead, they stand apart, without even holding hands, and reach only their lips toward each other to meet.

I also get the sense she’s a little shy, embarrassed, or unsure, since she giggles right afterward, and raises her shoulders — it's a nervous moment for her.\" But hey, not everyone gets married in front of thousands of people!  The Bottom Line:  \"This isn't a typical couple, they're people of royalty with rules to follow on public decorum,\" Cobb says. \"I think what happens behind closed doors can be very different from what you see in public.\"  Get all the health and fitness news directly in your feed.

            "text: Actress Meghan Markle was being eyed up by producers as a potential Bond girl before her relationship with Britain's Prince Harry was made public, it has been claimed.  Actress Meghan Markle was being eyed up by producers as a potential Bond girl before her relationship with Britain's Prince Harry was made public, it has been claimed.  Prior to becoming one half of one of the world's most headline-grabbing romances, Meghan was a successful actress, and had roles in movies as well as her long-running part in hit U.S. TV show Suits.  When she confirmed her engagement to Harry, Meghan revealed she would be giving up her acting career to devote all her time to new royal and philanthropic pursuits. But, according to Britain's The Sun newspaper, producers of the James Bond franchise had her in mind for a role in the next 007 film, nicknamed Bond 25, alongside Daniel Craig as the suave spy.  “Meghan fits the role of a Bond girl perfectly. She’s glamorous and sexy and a good actress,\" a source told the publication. \"The role more recently has gone to actresses deemed to be rising stars, and Meghan certainly was seen as that before her relationship with Harry became public.  \"The brief was to find a glamorous rising star, specifically someone American or Canadian.\"  The insider added that Baywatch actress Ilfenesh Hadera, 32, was also on the shortlist last year, alongside Meghan and three other names.  \"But the minute her relationship to Harry came to light they assumed she was out of the running so it soon became a list of four,\" the source added. \"Her engagement effectively spelt an end to her acting career too so that was the final blow.\"  Meghan has just spent Christmas with Harry and his royal relatives at Sandringham House, and will no doubt be seeing in 2018 with her new fiance as well.  In a blog post on her now defunct lifestyle website The Tig back in 2016, Meghan opened up about her New Year's resolutions, and admitted they are the same each and every year.  \"Stop biting my nails. Stop swearing,\" she wrote. \"These make my New Year’s resolution list nearly (AKA actually every) single year. The swearing comes in lulls triggered by being overworked or feeling mighty cheeky after a couple drinks. And when it comes to the biting of the nails – well, it still happens with a turbulent flight or a stressful day.  \"It’s unladylike. But then again, so is the swearing. Dammit.\"  Online Editors\n",

            "text: According to Prince Harry, more people should take a break from checking their mobile phones to \"process their thoughts\" instead of rushing through their day.  Prince Harry: ‘There Is Much More We Can Do’ To Promote Mental Health Awareness  Speaking at a panel event entitled “Encouraging Happy Young Minds” in Leeds, the prince suggested that young people need to take a moment to think things over before moving on. “I read recently that young people check their phones at least 150 times a day,” he said. “I’m sure we could all be more effective and efficient if we took a moment to process our thoughts rather than rush to the next one.”  Prince Harry, along with Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, have spearheaded new mental health campaign, Head Together, which has initiated important conversation around the country.  “I cannot tell you how pleased William, Catherine and I are that the dial seems to have shifted and that there is now a greater understanding, compassion and kindness for anyone who opens up about their struggles.  “But let’s not kid ourselves that the job is done – there is much more that we can do at every level to make conversations about mental health as commonplace as those about physical health.”  Mental health awareness is a subject close to his heart. Harry had earlier this year admitted to undergoing counseling to cope with the loss of mother Princess Diana.\n",

            "text: Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Eun Kyung Kim  One of the world's most eligible bachelors just took himself off the market.  Prince Harry is engaged to American actress Meghan Markle, Kensington Palace announced in a statement Monday.  “His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales is delighted to announce the engagement of Prince Harry to Ms. Meghan Markle,” according to the palace statement. The couple got engaged earlier this month in London. Prince Harry also \"sought and received the blessing of Ms. Markle's parents,\" the palace said.  Several hours later, the couple appeared hand-in-hand for a brief photo opportunity in the gardens of Kensington Palace, where a beaming prince said he realized Markle was the one for him \"the first time we met.\"  The couple plan to get married next May at St. George’s Chapel inside Windsor Castle. They will live in Nottingham Cottage, Harry's apartment at Kensington Palace.  Markle is a 36-year-old California native emerged from relative obscurity after news began to leak in the fall of 2016 that she was dating Prince Harry, 33.  The couple dated for more than a year before making their first official appearance together this past September at the Invictus Games in Toronto.  The newly betrothed couple, during their first public appearance together on Sept. 25, 2017, at the Invictus Games in Toronto, Canada. Chris Jackson / Getty Images  The pair met in early July 2016 after being set up on a blind date set up by a mutual friend, the couple told the BBC in a joint interview. The prince had never heard of the actress, who in turn knew only superficially about the royal.  The happy couple, at a photo call with reporters Monday after news broke about their engagement. Chris Jackson / Getty Images  The couple kept quiet about their relationship until Prince Harry issued a rare statement last November scolding paparazzi for endangering the safety of his girlfriend and blasting coverage he found racist and sexist.  But even after that announcement, the couple did not make any public appearances together until this past May when the two appeared at a polo match benefiting two of Prince Harry’s charities. Markle cheered on Harry as he played, but the two did not arrive or leave the event together.  Shutterstock / MEGA  For the September opening ceremony for this year's Invictus Games, the two originally sat several rows apart, but the couple stepped out publicly for the first time just days later, when they arrived, holding hands, for a wheelchair tennis match. They were seen laughing and being affectionate with each other throughout the event.  Prince Harry proposed to Markle in early November, while the couple enjoyed a “cozy” night in at his Kensington Palace apartment, where the two were roasting a chicken.  “It was just an amazing surprise. It was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got on one knee,” Markle said in a BBC interview following the announcement of their engagement.  The impending nuptials will be the biggest royal wedding since Harry's older brother, Prince William, married the former Kate Middleton on April 29, 2011.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said in a statement they were “very excited for Harry and Meghan.”  “It has been wonderful getting to know Meghan and see how happy she and Harry are together,” they said.  Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, also issued congratulations through Twitter.  \"The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh are delighted for the couple and wish them every happiness,\" Buckingham Palace said in a statement.  Prince Harry proposed to Markle with an engagement ring he designed with a center diamond from Botswana, where the two visited on vacation shortly after they met, and two outside diamonds from the personal collection of the Harry’s mother, the late Princess Diana.  It also will be the first time an American has married a British royal since King Edward VIII abdicated the throne in December 1936 to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced socialite. Like Simpson, Markle also is a divorcee. She was previously married to American film producer Trevor Engelson for nearly two years, divorcing in 2013.  In May, Prince Harry brought Markle as his date to the wedding reception of Kate's younger sister, Pippa Middleton. Royal watchers believe their attendance signaled how serious the relationship had become since it marked the first time Markle had mingled at a large gathering of royal family members.  Prince Harry is the fifth in line to the throne, behind the two children of his brother, Prince William, who is second in the line of succession behind their father. He will be bumped to sixth in line following the birth of William's third child next year.  Before he began dating Markle, the prince's romantic life had been calm and quiet for the past several years after a string of high-profile relationships. His most recent serious relationship, with model Cressida Bonas, ended in 2014 after two years together.  Follow Eun Kyung Kim on Twitter or Facebook.\n",

            "text: Advertisement  The royal family gathered this morning for a traditional Easter Sunday Service - at the chapel where Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will marry on May 19th.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, expecting their third child within weeks, broke usual protocol by arriving after the Queen at the Easter Mattins Service at St George's Chapel in Windsor.  The couple eschewed the downhill walk and took a royal car to the entrance, arriving several minutes after the Queen, who also arrived by car and was travelling without the Duke of Edinburgh, 96, who did not attend the service.  Although Meghan and Harry also chose not to appear at the chapel where they'll tie the knot next month; the Queen, dressed in cerise, was joined by Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall all also in attendance for the seasonal service.  Arriving without husband Mike Tindall and daughter Mia Grace, Zara did take the short downhill walk, showing off her blossoming bump in a blue bespoke Séraphine coat and hat by Jane Taylor as she chatted with Princess Beatrice, her sister Eugenie and husband-to-be Jack Brooksbank at the chapel's entrance.

Despite being eight months' pregnant, the Duchess has yet to park her favourite heels and finished off her smart look with a pair of towering caramel-hued shoes and matching clutch purse.

            "text: Queen Elizabeth II didn't blast Meghan Markle for exhibiting \"diva behavior\"  According to Gossip Cop, there is no truth to reports claiming that the Queen \"blasted\" the Duchess of Sussex for acting like a diva. In fact, the two have a great relationship.  \"She has developed an increasingly close, warm relationship with [both] the queen and her father-in-law, Prince Charles,\" the insider said. \"She wants to please them and is doing whatever she can to educate herself to make sure she doesn't put a foot wrong.\"  This news comes after the National Enquirer reported that the \"British monarchy is open to modernizing.\" However, Markle's \"tacky Hollywood-princess style is not what the royal family had in mind.\"  The tabloid alleged that Markle's diva behavior has gotten under everyone's skin. The unidentified source said that the Queen has \"told Prince Harry to give his bossy bride a 'shape up or else' ultimatum because she's wrecked his credibility.\"  The insider added that the Queen called Markle to her chambers and reprimanded her about her fashion. Queen Elizabeth reportedly told the new duchess to dress down because she's not starring in a reality TV show but is representing the world's most prestigious family.  The Queen wants Markle to \"change her ways immediately.\" Due to the said incidents, the Duchess of Sussex reportedly earned the nickname \"Meghan the Menace.\"  Sally Osman, the director of royal communication was reportedly the first casualty of Markle's diva behavior. But Gossip Cop said that it was not true. The former \"Suits\" star moved to London last year, but it was only a week ago that Osman and another palace aide resigned. Also, Osman was not fired, she resigned  Despite the report, the Queen and the Duchess of Sussex get along very well. In fact, the monarch has given Markle privileges that Kate Middleton didn't receive. For instance, Her Majesty invited Markle to visit Cheshire using her personal train. Only the senior royals have used the said transportation. In fact, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince Harry haven't used it.  Also, Queen Elizabeth II invited the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to the Queen's Young Leaders Awards ceremony. A number of royals were invited to the event since it started in 2014, but Middleton had never been to it.  Photo: Getty Images/Jeff J Mitchell\n",

            "text: On Saturday, Prince Harry, 33, and Meghan Markle, 36, will wed at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle in a ceremony officiated by . . . sorry, we almost fell asleep there. We know all those details. You know what’s much more fun to discuss than wedding logistics? Wedding drama.  And unlike many royal weddings, there has been no shortage of it, especially in the last week. Here’s all the gossip leading up to the year’s most anticipated nuptials:  What’s up with Meghan’s dad?  Thomas Markle Sr., 73, used to work as a TV lighting director and cinematographer and has since retired to Mexico. Much has been made of Meghan’s relationship with her dad, as he and her mom divorced when Meghan was 6. Thomas has never met Harry, but they’ve reportedly spoken by phone. An “insider” recently told People magazine, “Like any father-daughter relationship, there have been ups and downs over the years. But they are in a good place now.”  Then it gets confusing. In early May, Meghan’s half-brother (more about him later) sent a nasty letter to Harry, imploring him not to marry Meghan and calling it “the biggest mistake in wedding history.” The letter, obtained by In Touch magazine, claimed Meghan’s father had not received an invitation to the wedding. However, the palace released a statement at the time confirming that Thomas would walk his daughter down the aisle. So that was weird.  However, things fell apart this week when it was revealed that Thomas Sr. had been working with the paparazzi to stage photos of himself: Reading a book on Great Britain, getting fitted for a suit, etc. This did not go over well, as the palace had chastised the media for badgering him. On Monday, Thomas told TMZ that he regretted the photos, saying they were “stupid and hammy,” and said he would not be attending the wedding because of a recent heart attack. A day later, he changed his mind and said he would love to go. Then, he contacted TMZ once more to say that he had to undergo heart surgery on Wednesday, and he would officially not be attending.  Early in the week, the palace sidestepped commenting on this mess, as a spokesperson simply said, “This is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation.”  On Thursday, Markle finally weighed in: “Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.”  And what’s up with her half-sister?  Samantha Markle, 53, is Thomas Sr.’s daughter from his first marriage and lives in Florida with her three kids. She made headlines early in Meghan and Harry’s relationship when it was reported she was penning a tell-all memoir called “The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister.” (The two reportedly haven’t spoken in years.) Samantha also trashed her half-sister in interviews, calling her a “shallow social climber” only interested in fame. Later, she changed her tune, saying Meghan was “absolutely lovely.”  So guess who wasn’t invited to the wedding? Plus, Samantha admitted this week she was the one who persuaded their father to take those staged pictures, thinking it would help improve his image. This earned her a dressing-down from TV host Piers Morgan, who called her a “little vulture.”  Why did Meghan’s half-brother write such a cruel letter to Harry?  It’s unclear — maybe Thomas Jr., 50 (Thomas Sr.’s son from his first marriage) was upset that he was left off the wedding guest list? “Meghan Markle is obviously not the right woman for you,” he wrote to Harry, adding his half-sister was a “jaded, shallow, conceited woman that will make a joke of you and the royal family heritage.” Thomas Jr. later appeared to regret this, as he gave a follow-up letter to In Touch in which he begged Meghan for a wedding invitation, trying to guilt her with the line, “We are all still family.” We’re guessing that it did not work.  However, Thomas Jr.’s ex-wife, Tracy, and their sons, Tyler and Thomas, did not let that deter them — they recently landed in London, where they’ll be acting as wedding correspondents for “Good Morning Britain.”    Meghan Markle watches the closing ceremonies of the Invictus Games with her mother, Doria Ragland, in Toronto last year. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press/AP)  What about her mom?    Doria Ragland, 61, is a yoga instructor and social worker. Meghan is her only child, and they’re extremely close. Before the engagement, she met Harry, who proclaimed her “amazing.” Tabloids reported that Doria, who lives in Los Angeles, recently quit her job at a mental health clinic. (Hmmm, could she be moving out of the country sometime in the future?) It has been speculated that Doria could walk her daughter down the aisle. (Update: Prince Charles is actually going to do it.) Either way, she arrived in London earlier this week to spend time with Meghan and meet the royal family.  Is her ex-husband really producing a TV show based on their relationship?  Meghan married film producer Trevor Engelson in 2011; they split two years later. In September 2017, Deadline reported that Engelson was shopping a fictional TV comedy with the description: “Divorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London’s tabloid media, is next level.” Hmmm. The idea was apparently sparked when Engelson and another producer were talking about what could have happened if he and Meghan had kids.  However, the Sun recently reported that Engelson, after being persuaded by Meghan and some mutual friends, has put the project on hold — for now.  Is there any drama on Harry’s side of the family?  Have you seen “The Crown”? You have? Good. That’s probably all the intense Windsor drama you’re going to get. Because Harry and Meghan limited the size of their guest list — it still includes 600 people, so everyone can chill — some distant relatives who were invited to William’s wedding were not invited to Harry’s. The royals are trained in remaining tight-lipped about most drama, of course, so we don’t know whether these minor snubs have caused any problems.  What’s up with those rumors about Meghan and Kate feuding?  Meghan’s eloquence and openness have earned her comparisons to Harry’s late mother, Princess Diana, often called the “People’s Princess.” Several tabloids report Kate is jealous of this comparison and Meghan’s overall popularity with the family and public.  But some rumors are simply rumors, friends, as Meghan and Kate have shown no signs of fighting — in public, at least. They both attended a Royal Foundation event with their significant others in February, during which the foursome were asked whether they ever disagree.  William replied, “Ohhh, yes,” according to Vanity Fair. Harry elaborated: “I think it’s really good we have got four different personalities and we all have that same passion to make a difference. We have different opinions and they work really well [together].” He then noted that they are all “stuck together for the rest of our lives,” to which Meghan added, “Togetherness at its finest.”    Prince Harry, Meghan Markle and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, attend the first annual Royal Foundation Forum. (Chris Jackson/AFP/Getty Images)  What roles will William and Kate have in the wedding?  A few months after William said his younger brother had not yet asked him to be his best man — “It could be a sensitive subject,” he joked on a radio show — Kensington Palace announced that William would, in fact, return the favor that Harry did for him in 2011. Kate probably won’t have a formal role during the ceremony, according to a Vanity Fair source who said Meghan and Harry “just want Kate to be able to enjoy the day and not worry about anything.” William and Kate’s older children, George and Charlotte, will be in the wedding party, while young Louis will stay at home.  [Little royals George and Charlotte threaten to upstage everyone else at Uncle Harry’s wedding]  Are Harry’s exes invited to the wedding?  Probably! Harry is said to be on good terms with Cressida Bonas, whom he dated for two years, and Chelsy Davy, whom he dated on-and-off for seven. There’s also precedent: Several of William’s exes attended his wedding, and Prince Charles’s then-ex-girlfriend — now his wife, Duchess Camilla — attended his to Diana.  Which celebrities will be there?  Never forget that before she ascended to royalty, Meghan was a mere Hollywood celebrity. Several actors from “Suits,” the USA network legal drama that propelled her to fame, are expected to attend the ceremony: Gabriel Macht, Patrick J. Adams, Sarah Rafferty, Gina Torres and Rick Hoffman. All five Spice Girls — British royalty in their own right — likely will, too, along with Meghan’s pals Priyanka Chopra and Serena Williams. Despite their friendship with Harry, Barack and Michelle Obama will not be present.

Meghan Markle at Christmas 2017 Tim Rooke/REX/Shutterstock  Meghan joined the royal family for their Christmas celebrations last year, despite it being unusual for non-married partners of senior members of the family to join the Queen for Christmas Day celebrations. Despite being engaged to William, in 2010 Kate spent her last Christmas as a single woman with her own family. But, unlike Kate, Meghan doesn’t have any family in the U.K. — and clearly Harry will have wanted his new fiancée by his side.  Despite reports that Prince William and Kate Middleton would likely be spending the holiday with Kate’s family in Bucklebury, the couple will be joining the rest of the royal family. They will stay at their nearby home of Anmer Hall with children Prince George, 5, Princess Charlotte, 3, and 8-month-old Prince Louis.

Every Photo You Need to See of the Royal Family Getting Festive  Claims have swirled about tension between brothers William and Harry and their wives, Kate and Meghan. But contrary to those reports, a source tells PEOPLE that the couples enjoyed a memorable first Christmas together last year, when Meghan made her debut walk to church with the royal family on Christmas Day.  “They really loved Christmas and all had a wonderful time,” the source says. “I think the two women got on — they are definitely not best friends, but it was a really special time for them all to spend together.”  Meghan Markle, Prince Harry and Doria Ragland BEN STANSALL/AFP/Getty  One person who won’t be joining in the festivities? Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland.  Despite previous reports that Doria was invited to spend Christmas with the royal family, PEOPLE confirms that the Los-Angeles based yoga instructor and social worker will not be in Norfolk.  The Middletons have never joined the royals for Christmas, but Kate and William decided to skip spending Christmas at Sandringham in 2016. Instead, they brought Prince George and Princess Charlotte to church with Kate’s family in Englefield, England, near her childhood home.  The news comes shortly after PEOPLE confirmed that Doria will not be moving in when Meghan and Harry leave Kensington Palace for their new home at Windsor Castle’s Frogmore Cottage next year. Doria may have rooms set aside for her in the cottage, located close to the house where Harry and Meghan’s evening wedding party was held and where their engagement photos were taken about a year ago, but she’s not making a permanent move there.\n",

            "text: Death of Diana redirects here. For information on the murder of Diana Miller, see Murder of Diana Miller  On 31 August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales died as a result of injuries sustained in a car crash in the Pont de l'Alma road tunnel in Paris, France. Her companion, Dodi Fayed, and the driver of the Mercedes S280, Henri Paul, were pronounced dead at the scene. A fourth passenger in the car, bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, was seriously injured but survived.  Although the media blamed the behaviour of the paparazzi who followed the car, a French judicial investigation in 1999 found that the crash was caused by Henri Paul, who lost control of the Mercedes at high speed while he was intoxicated and under the effects of prescription drugs. Paul was the deputy head of security at the Hôtel Ritz at the time of the crash and had goaded the paparazzi waiting outside the hotel earlier.[1] His inebriation may have been made worse by anti-depressants and traces of an anti-psychotic in his body.[2][3] The investigation concluded that the photographers were not near the Mercedes when it crashed.[4] After hearing evidence at the British inquest in 2008, a jury returned to a verdict of \"unlawful killing\" by Paul and the paparazzi pursuing the car.[5]  Diana's death caused a substantial outpouring of worldwide grief, including numerous floral tributes and her funeral was watched by an estimated 2 billion people. The Royal Family were criticised in the press for their reaction to Diana's death.  Circumstances [ edit ]  Events preceding the crash [ edit ]  A car similar to that involved in the accident.  On Saturday, 30 August 1997, Diana left Sardinia on a private jet and arrived in Paris with Dodi Fayed, the son of Mohamed Al-Fayed.[6] They had stopped there en route to London, having spent the preceding nine days together on board Mohamed Al-Fayed's yacht Jonikal on the French and Italian Riviera. They had intended to stay there for the night. Mohamed Al-Fayed was and is the owner of the Hôtel Ritz Paris. He also owned an apartment in Rue Arsène Houssaye, a short distance from the hotel, just off the Avenue des Champs Elysées.  Henri Paul, the deputy head of security at the Ritz Hotel, had been instructed to drive the hired black 1994 Mercedes-Benz S280 in order to elude the paparazzi;[9] a decoy vehicle left the Ritz first from the main entrance on Place Vendôme, attracting a throng of photographers. Diana and Fayed then departed from the hotel's rear entrance,[10] Rue Cambon at around 00:20 on 31 August CEST (22:20 on 30 August UTC), heading for the apartment in Rue Arsène Houssaye. They did this to avoid the nearly 30 photographers waiting in the front of the hotel.[10] They were the rear passengers; Trevor Rees-Jones, a member of the Fayed family's personal protection team, was in the (right) front passenger seat. It was believed that Diana and Dodi were not wearing seat belts.[12] After leaving the Rue Cambon and crossing the Place de la Concorde, they drove along Cours la Reine and Cours Albert 1er – the embankment road along the right bank of the River Seine – into the Place de l'Alma underpass.[13]  The crash [ edit ]  At 12:23 a.m., Paul lost control of the vehicle at the entrance to the Pont de l'Alma tunnel. The car struck the righthand wall and then swerved to the left of the two-lane carriageway before it collided head-on with the 13th pillar that supported the roof.[14] The car was travelling at an estimated speed of 105 km/h (65 mph).[15] It then spun and hit the stone wall of the tunnel backwards, finally coming to a stop. The impact caused substantial damage, particularly to the front half of the vehicle, as there was no guard rail between the pillars to prevent this. Witnesses arriving shortly after the accident reported smoke.[17] Witnesses also reported that photographers on motorcycles \"swarmed the Mercedes sedan before it entered the tunnel.\"[12]  The aftermath [ edit ]  The entrance to the Pont de l'Alma Tunnel, the site where Diana was fatally injured  As the victims lay in the wrecked car, the photographers, who had been driving slower and were accordingly some distance behind the Mercedes, reached the scene. The photographers were on motorcycles.[10] Some rushed to help, tried to open the doors and help the victims, while some of them took pictures. Airbags were deployed.[19] Police arrived on scene around 10 minutes after the crash at 00:30 and an ambulance was on site five minutes after the police, according to witnesses.[19] France Info radio reported that one photographer was beaten by witnesses who were horrified by the scene.[12] Five of the photographers were taken into custody.[17] Later, two others were detained and around 20 rolls of film were taken from the photographers.[12] Police also impounded their vehicles.[12] Firemen also arrived to help remove the victims.[20]  Still conscious, Rees-Jones had suffered multiple serious facial injuries and a head contusion.[21] The front occupants' airbags had functioned normally.[22] The occupants were not wearing seat belts.[a] Diana, who had been sitting in the right rear passenger seat, was still conscious. Critically injured, Diana was reported to murmur repeatedly, \"Oh my God,\" and after the photographers and other helpers were pushed away by police, \"Leave me alone.\"[23] In June 2007 the Channel 4 documentary Diana: The Witnesses in the Tunnel claimed that the first person to touch Diana was Dr. Maillez,[24] who chanced upon the scene. He reported that Diana had no visible injuries but was in shock. Diana was removed from the car at 1:00 am. She then went into cardiac arrest and following external cardiopulmonary resuscitation, her heart started beating again.[26] She was moved to the SAMU ambulance at 1:18 am, left the scene at 1:41 am and arrived at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital at 2:06 am.[27]  Fayed had been sitting in the left rear passenger seat and was shortly afterwards pronounced dead.[28] Paul was declared dead on removal from the wreckage. Both were taken to the Institut Médico-Légal (IML), the Paris mortuary, not to a hospital. Paul was later found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.175 grams per 100 mL of blood - about 3.5 times the legal limit in France.[21]  Despite attempts to save her, Diana's internal injuries were too extensive: her heart had been displaced to the right side of the chest, which tore the pulmonary vein and the pericardium. Despite lengthy resuscitation attempts, including internal cardiac massage, she died at 4:00 a.m.[31] Anesthesiologist Bruno Riou announced her death at 6 am at a news conference held at the hospital.[17][32]  Later that morning, Jean-Pierre Chevènement (French Minister of the Interior) visited the hospital with French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.[33] At around 5:00 pm, Diana's former husband, Charles, Prince of Wales, and her two older sisters, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, arrived in Paris. The group visited the hospital along with French President Jacques Chirac and thanked the doctors for trying to save her life.[35] Prince Charles accompanied Diana's body home on Sunday.[36] Her body was taken to the Hammersmith and Fulham mortuary in London for its autopsy later that day.[37]  Initial media reports stated Diana's car had collided with the pillar at 190 km/h (120 mph), and that the speedometer's needle had jammed at that position.[21] It was later announced the car's speed on collision was about 95–110 km/h (60–70 mph). The car was certainly travelling much faster than the speed limit of 50 km/h (31 mph). In 1999, a French investigation concluded the Mercedes had come into contact with another vehicle (a white Fiat Uno) in the tunnel.[38] The driver of that vehicle has never been conclusively traced, although many believe the driver of the Fiat was Le Van Thanh but the specific vehicle has not been identified.[39] [38]  It was remarked by Robin Cook, the British Foreign Secretary, that if the accident had been caused in part by being hounded by paparazzi, that it would be \"doubly tragic.\"[10] Diana's brother also blamed tabloid media for her death.[40] An 18-month French judicial investigation concluded in 1999 that the crash was caused by Paul, who lost control at high speed while intoxicated.[41]  Mourning [ edit ]  Members of the public were invited to sign a book of condolence at St. James Palace.[42] All 11,000 light bulbs at Harrods were turned off and not switched on again until after the funeral.[42] Throughout the night, members of the Women's Royal Voluntary Service and the Salvation Army provided support for people queuing along the Mall.[43] More than one million bouquets were left at her London home, Kensington Palace,[44] while at her family's estate of Althorp the public was asked to stop bringing flowers as the volume of people and flowers in the surrounding roads was said to be causing a threat to public safety.[45]  By 10 September, the pile of flowers outside Kensington Gardens was 5 feet (1.5 m) deep in places and the bottom layer had started to compost.[46] The people were quiet, queuing patiently to sign the book and leave their gifts. There were a few minor incidents. Fabio Piras, a Sardinian tourist, was given a one-week prison sentence on 10 September for having taken a teddy bear from the pile. When the sentence was later reduced to a £100 fine, Piras was punched in the face by a member of the public when he left the court.[47] The next day two Slovakian tourists, Maria Rigolova, a 54-year-old secondary school teacher and Agnese Sihelksa, a 50-year-old communications technician, were each given a 28-day prison sentence for having taken 11 teddy bears and a number of flowers from the pile outside the palace.[48] This was reduced to a fine of £200 each.[49]  Funeral [ edit ]  Early on, it was uncertain if it would be a state funeral since Diana had lost her royal status because of her divorce from Prince Charles in 1996.[50]  Diana's death was met with extraordinary public expressions of grief, and her funeral at Westminster Abbey on 6 September drew an estimated 3 million mourners and onlookers in London,[51][52] and worldwide television coverage watched by 2.5 billion people.[53] It was aired to 200 countries in 44 languages.[54] Outside the Abbey and in Hyde Park crowds watched and listened to proceedings on large outdoor screens and speakers as guests filed in, including representatives of the many charities of which Diana was patron. Attendants included US First Lady Hillary Clinton, Bernadette Chirac, wife of the French President, Jacques Chirac and other celebrities, including Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti and friends of Diana, George Michael and Elton John.[23][55] John performed a rewritten version of his song \"Candle in the Wind\" that was dedicated to her.[56] Protocol was disregarded when the guests applauded the speech by Diana's younger brother Earl Spencer, who strongly criticised the press and indirectly criticised the Royal Family for their treatment of her.[57] The funeral is estimated to have been watched by 31.5 million viewers in Britain. Precise calculation of the worldwide audience is not possible, but estimated at around 2.5 billion.[58]  After the end of the ceremony, the coffin was driven to Althorp in a Daimler hearse.[59] Mourners cast flowers at the funeral procession for almost the entire length of its journey and vehicles even stopped on the opposite carriageway of the M1 motorway as the cars passed.[60]  In a private ceremony, Diana was buried on an island in the middle of a lake called The Oval, which is part of the Pleasure Garden at Althorp.[61] In her coffin, she wore a black Catherine Walker dress and is clutching a rosary in her hands. The rosary had been a gift from Mother Teresa of Calcutta, a confidante of Diana, who had died the day before her funeral. A visitors' centre is open during summer months, with an exhibition about her and a walk around the lake. All profits are donated to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund.[62]  Reactions [ edit ]  Some criticised the reaction to Diana's death at the time as being \"hysterical\" and \"irrational\". As early as 1998 philosopher Anthony O'Hear identified the mourning as a defining point in the \"sentimentalisation of Britain\", a media-fuelled phenomenon where image and reality become blurred.[63] Oasis bandleader Noel Gallagher responded to the reaction with \"The woman's dead. Shut up. Get over it\".[64] These criticisms were repeated on the 10th anniversary, when journalist Jonathan Freedland expressed the opinion that \"It has become an embarrassing memory, like a mawkish, self-pitying teenage entry in a diary ... we cringe to think about it.\" In 2010, Theodore Dalrymple suggested \"sentimentality, both spontaneous and generated by the exaggerated attention of the media, that was necessary to turn the death of the princess into an event of such magnitude thus served a political purpose, one that was inherently dishonest in a way that parallels the dishonesty that lies behind much sentimentality itself\".[65] Some cultural analysts disagreed. Sociologist Deborah Steinberg pointed out that many Britons associated Diana not with the Royal Family but with social change and a more liberal society: \"I don't think it was hysteria, the loss of a public figure can be a touchstone for other issues.\"[66] Carol Wallace of People Magazine said that the fascination with Diana's death had to do with \"the fairy tale failing to end happily – twice, first when she got divorced and now that she died.\"[67]  Royal family [ edit ]  The Queen expressed her dismay at Diana's death when she found out.[68] Prince Charles was the person who told their sons about their mother's death.[68] The princes were told of her death before dawn, as Prince Charles had to wake them up to share the tragic news.[69] The boys were close to their mother.[69] On Sunday morning after Diana's death, Queen Elizabeth, Princes Charles, William and Harry all wore black to church services at Balmoral Castle.[70] Prince Charles, William and Harry would be coming back to London on Friday, September 5.[71] The Queen, who returned to London from Balmoral, agreed to a television broadcast to the nation.[72]  The Royal Family was criticised for a rigid adherence to protocol, and their concern to care for Diana's grieving sons, was interpreted as a lack of compassion.[73] In particular, the refusal of Buckingham Palace to fly the Royal Standard at half-mast provoked angry headlines in newspapers.[73][74] \"Where is our Queen? Where is her Flag?\" asked The Sun.[72] The Palace's stance was one of royal protocol: no flag could fly over Buckingham Palace, as the Royal Standard is only flown when the Queen is in residence, and the Queen was then in Scotland. The Royal Standard never flies at half-mast as it is the Sovereign's flag and there is never an interregnum or vacancy in the monarchy, as the new monarch immediately succeeds his or her predecessor. Finally, as a compromise, the Union Flag was flown at half-mast as the Queen left for Westminster Abbey on the day of the funeral.[72] This set a precedent, and Buckingham Palace has subsequently flown the Union Flag when the Queen is not in residence.[75] A rift between Prince Charles and the Queen's private secretary Sir Robert Fellowes (Diana's brother-in-law) was reported in the media over what the nature of the Princess's funeral should be with Charles demanding a public funeral and Fellowes supporting the Queen's idea of a private one.[76] The Palace later issued a statement denying such rumours.[76]  Prince Harry said in 2017 that the death of his mother caused severe depression and grief.[77] Prince William was 15 and Harry was 12 when Diana died.[78]  Politicians' reactions [ edit ]  President Bill Clinton's remarks on Diana's death  British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said that he \"felt utterly devastated by the death of the Princess.\"[50] President Bill Clinton said that he and his wife, Hillary Clinton were \"profoundly saddened\" when they found out about her death.[17] Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary-General said that her death \"has robbed the world of a consistent and committed voice for the improvement of the lives of suffering children worldwide.\"[70] In Australia, the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, condemned the paparazzi for their overzealous coverage of Diana.[79] Russian President Boris Yeltsin praised Diana's charity work in a statement saying \"All know of Princess Diana's big contribution to charitable work, and not only in Great Britain\".[80][81] Among other politicians who sent messages of condolences were South African President Nelson Mandela, Australian Prime Minister John Howard, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[80]  Public reactions [ edit ]  In London, thousands of people carried bouquets and stood outside of Buckingham Palace after the news of her death.[70] People started bringing flowers within an hour after the news was shared.[68] The BBC flew its flags at half-mast.[70] Both radio and television aired the British national anthem, \"God Save the Queen,\" in response to Diana's death.[68]  People in the United States were shocked at her death.[82] In Paris, thousands of people visited the site of the crash and the hospital where Diana died.[83] People brought flowers and also attempted to visit the Hotel Ritz, as well.[83] In Bosnia, a land-mine survivor, Jasminko Bjelic, who had met Diana only three weeks earlier, said, \"She was our friend.\"[70] Following her death many celebrities including actors and singers blamed the paparazzi and condemned their reckless behavior.[84][85]  During the four weeks following her funeral, the suicide rate in England and Wales rose by 17% and cases of deliberate self-harm by 44.3% compared with the average for that period in the four previous years. Researchers suggest that this was caused by the \"identification\" effect, as the greatest increase in suicides was by people most similar to Diana: women aged 25 to 44, whose suicide rate increased by over 45%.[86] Another research showed that 50% of Britons and 27% of Americans were deeply affected by her death as if someone they knew had died. It also concluded that in general women were more affected than men in both of the countries.[87] The same research showed that Diana's \"charitable endeavors\" and \"ability to identify with ordinary people\" were among the main factors that caused her to be admired and respected by the people.[87] In the weeks after her death counselling services reported an increase in the number of phone calls by the people who were seeking help due to grief or distress.[88]  The national grieving for Diana had economic effects. In the short term, the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) estimated that retail sales dropped 1% that week. Traffic congestion in central London as crowds went to the palaces to pay homage likewise adversely affected productivity, and the CEBR estimated that would cost businesses £200 million, or a total loss of 0.1% of gross domestic product for the third quarter of 1997. However, in the long run the CEBR expected that to be offset by increased tourism and memorabilia sales.[89]  Memorials [ edit ]  Flame of Liberty, the unofficial Diana memorial in Paris, France The, the unofficial Diana memorial in Paris, France  In the years after her death, interest in the life of Diana has remained high. As a temporary memorial, the public co-opted the Flamme de la Liberté (Flame of Liberty), a monument near the Alma Tunnel related to the French donation of the Statue of Liberty to the United States. The messages of condolence have since been removed and its use as a Diana memorial has discontinued, though visitors still leave messages in her memory. A permanent memorial, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain, was opened by the Queen in Hyde Park in London on 6 July 2004.[90]  Inquests [ edit ]  Under English law, an inquest is required in cases of sudden or unexplained death.[91][92] A French judicial investigation had already been carried out but the 6,000-page report was never published.[93] On 6 January 2004, six years after her death, an inquest into the deaths of Diana and Fayed opened in London held by Michael Burgess, the coroner of the Queen's household.[92] The coroner asked the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir John Stevens, to make inquiries, in response to speculation that the deaths were not an accident.[92][94] The police investigation reported its findings in Operation Paget in December 2006.[95]  In January 2006, Lord Stevens explained in an interview on GMTV that the case is substantially more complex than once thought. The Sunday Times wrote on 29 January 2006 that agents of the British secret service were cross-examined because they were in Paris at the time of the crash. It was suggested in many journals that these agents might have exchanged the blood test of the driver with another blood sample (although no evidence for this has been forthcoming).[96][97]  The inquests into the deaths of Diana and Fayed opened on 8 January 2007, with Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss acting as Deputy Coroner of the Queen's Household for the Diana inquest and Assistant Deputy Coroner for Surrey in relation to the Fayed inquest. Butler-Sloss originally intended to sit without a jury;[98] this decision was later overturned by the High Court,[99] as well as the jurisdiction of the Coroner of the Queen's Household. On 24 April 2007, Butler-Sloss stepped down, saying she lacked the experience required to deal with an inquest with a jury.[100] The role of Coroner for the inquests was transferred to Lord Justice Scott Baker, who formally took up the role on 13 June as Coroner for Inner West London.[101]  On 27 July 2007, Baker, following representations for the lawyers of the interested parties, issued a list of issues likely to be raised at the inquest, many of which had been dealt with in great detail by Operation Paget:  Whether driver error on the part of Henri Paul caused or contributed to the cause of the collision Whether Henri Paul's ability to drive was impaired through drink or drugs Whether a Fiat Uno or any other vehicle caused or contributed to the collision Whether the actions of the Paparazzi caused or contributed to the cause of the collision Whether the road/tunnel layout and construction were inherently dangerous and, if so, whether this contributed to the collision Whether any bright/flashing lights contributed to or caused the collision and, if so, their source Whose decision it was that the Princess of Wales and Dodi Al Fayed should leave from the rear entrance to the Ritz and that Henri Paul should drive the vehicle Henri Paul's movements between 7 and 10 pm on 30 August 1997 The explanation for the money in Henri Paul's possession on 30 August 1997 and in his bank account Whether Andanson was in Paris on the night of the collision Whether Diana's life would have been saved if she had reached hospital sooner or if her medical treatment had been different Whether Diana was pregnant Whether Diana and Dodi Al Fayed were about to announce their engagement Whether and, if so in what circumstances, the Princess of Wales feared for her life The circumstances relating to the purchase of the ring The circumstances in which Diana's body was embalmed Whether the evidence of Tomlinson throws any light on the collision Whether the British or any other security services had any involvement in the collision Whether there was anything sinister about (i) the Cherruault burglary or (ii) the disturbance at the Big Pictures agency Whether correspondence belonging to the Princess of Wales (including some from Prince Philip) has disappeared, and if so the circumstances.[102]  The inquests officially began on 2 October 2007 with the swearing of a jury of six women and five men. Scott Baker delivered a lengthy opening statement giving general instructions to the jury and introducing the evidence.[103] The BBC reported that Mohamed Al-Fayed, having earlier reiterated his claim that his son and Diana were murdered by the Royal Family, immediately criticised the opening statement as biased.[104]  The inquest heard evidence from people connected with Diana and the events leading to her death, including Paul Burrell, Mohamed Al-Fayed, her stepmother, the survivor of the crash, and the former head of MI5.[105]  Scott Baker began his summing up to the jury on 31 March 2008.[106] He opened by telling the jury \"no-one except you and I and, I think, the gentleman in the public gallery with Diana and Fayed painted on his forehead sat through every word of evidence\" and concluded that there was \"not a shred of evidence\" that Diana's death had been ordered by the Duke of Edinburgh or organised by the security services.[107] Lord Justice Scott Baker concluded his summing up on Wednesday, 2 April 2008.[108] After summing up, the jury retired to consider five verdicts, namely unlawful killing by the negligence of either or both the following vehicles or Paul; accidental death or an open verdict.[106] The jury decided on 7 April 2008 that Diana had been unlawfully killed by the following vehicles.[109][110] Princes William and Harry released a statement in which they said that they \"agree with their verdicts and are both hugely grateful.\"[111] Mohamed Al Fayed also said that he would accept the verdict and \"abandon his 10-year campaign to prove that Diana and Dodi were murdered in a conspiracy\".[112]  The cost of the inquiry exceeded £12.5 million, with the coroner's inquest at £4.5 million, and a further £8 million spent on the Metropolitan Police investigation. It lasted 6 months and heard 250 witnesses, with the cost heavily criticised in the media.[113]  Related lawsuits [ edit ]  Nine photographers who had been following Diana and Dodi in 1997, were charged with manslaughter in France.[114] France's \"highest court\" dropped the charges in 2002.[114]  Three photographers who took pictures of the aftermath of the crash on 31 August 1997 had their photographs confiscated and were tried for invasion of privacy for taking pictures through the open door of the crashed car.[114][115] The photographers, who were part of the \"paparazzi\" were acquitted in 2003.[114]  Conspiracy theories [ edit ]  Although the initial French investigation found that Diana had died as a result of an accident, several conspiracy theories have been raised.[116] Since February 1998, Fayed's father, Mohamed Al-Fayed (the owner of the Hôtel Ritz, where Paul worked, and thus potentially liable for wrongful death liability) has claimed that the crash was a result of a conspiracy,[117] and later contended that the crash was orchestrated by MI6 on the instructions of the Royal Family.[118] His claims were dismissed by a French judicial investigation[2] and by Operation Paget, a Metropolitan Police Service inquiry that concluded in 2006.[119] An inquest headed by Lord Justice Scott Baker into the deaths of Diana and Fayed began at the Royal Courts of Justice, London, on 2 October 2007, a continuation of the inquest that began in 2004.[100] On 7 April 2008, the jury concluded that Diana and Fayed were the victims of an \"unlawful killing\" by the \"grossly negligent\" chauffeur Paul and the drivers of the following vehicles.[120] Additional factors were \"the impairment of the judgment of the driver of the Mercedes through alcohol\" and \"the death of the deceased was caused or contributed to by the fact that the deceased was not wearing a seat belt, the fact that the Mercedes struck the pillar in the Alma Tunnel rather than colliding with something else\".[109]  On 17 August 2013, Scotland Yard revealed that they were examining the credibility of information from a source that alleged that Diana was murdered by a member of the British military.[121][122]  In the media [ edit ]  After Dark television discussion - \"After Diana\" - broadcast on A specialtelevision discussion - \"After Diana\" - broadcast on Channel 4 on 13 September 1997  Actor George Clooney publicly lambasted several tabloids and paparazzi agencies following Diana's death. A few of the tabloids boycotted Clooney following the outburst, stating that he \"owed a fair portion of his celebrity\" to the tabloids and photo agencies in question.[123]  Diana was ranked third in the 2002 Great Britons poll sponsored by the BBC and voted for by the British public, after Sir Winston Churchill (1st) (a distant cousin), and Isambard Kingdom Brunel (2nd), just above Charles Darwin (4th), William Shakespeare (5th), and Isaac Newton (6th). That same year, another British poll named Diana's death as the most important event in the country's last 100 years.[124] Historian Nick Barrett criticised this outcome as being \"a pretty shocking result\".[125]  Later in 2004, US TV network CBS showed pictures of the crash scene in one of its programmes which were \"part of a 4,000-page French government report.\" It showed an intact rear side and centre section of the Mercedes, including one of an unbloodied Diana with no outward injuries crouched on the rear floor with her back to the right passenger seat—the right rear door is fully open. The release of these pictures were poorly received in the UK, where it was felt that the privacy of Diana was being infringed.[126] Buckingham Palace, UK Prime Minister and Diana's brother condemned the action, while CBS defended its decision saying that the pictures \"are placed in journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given to Princess Diana just after the crash.\"[127]  On 13 July 2006, Italian magazine Chi published photographs that showed Diana amid the wreckage of the car crash;[128] the photos were released despite an unofficial blackout on such photographs being published.[129][b] The editor of Chi defended his decision by saying he published the photographs simply because they had not been previously seen, and he felt the images were not disrespectful to the memory of Diana.[129]  The British newspaper The Daily Express has been criticised for continued and sustained coverage of Princess Diana following her death. A 2006 report in The Guardian showed that the newspaper had mentioned her in numerous recent news stories, with headlines including \"Perhaps Diana should have worn seatbelt\", \"Diana inquiry chief's laptop secrets stolen\", \"£250,000 a year bill to run Diana fountain\" and \"Diana seatbelt sabotage probe\".[130]  Internet coverage [ edit ]  Diana's death occurred at a time when Internet use in the developed world was booming, and several national newspapers and at least one British regional newspaper had already launched online news services. BBC News had set up online coverage of the general election earlier in 1997[131] and as a result of the widespread public and media attention that Diana's death resulted in, BBC News swiftly created a website featuring news coverage of Diana's death and the events that followed it. Diana's death helped BBC News officials realise how important online news services were becoming, and a full online news service was launched on 4 November that year, alongside the launch of the BBC's rolling news channel BBC News 24 on 9 November.[132]  See also [ edit ]  References [ edit ]  Notes [ edit ]  ^ Although there are conflicting reports (such as BBC and CNN ), the investigation Operation Paget report notes \"Operation Paget's view is that none of the seat belts were being worn at the time of the impact, including that of Trevor Rees-Jones.\" (Page 421) [1] ^ The photographs, taken minutes after the accident, show her slumped in the back seat while a paramedic attempts to fit an oxygen mask over her face.

            "text: Royal baby No. 3 is here! Kate Middleton and Prince William welcomed their third child on Monday, April 23 at 11:01 a.m. in the Lindo Wing at St. Mary’s hospital.    Just like when Prince George and Princess Charlotte were born, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stopped for a few quick photos in front of the hospital before they returned to Kensington Palace with their new prince. Duchess Kate wore a red dress with a white lace collar by Jenny Packham, making this the third time she’s worn a bespoke dress by the British designer for her post-birth appearances.

Both dresses were bright red with a white Peter Pan collar.  Getty Images  This wasn't the first time Kate paid homage to her late mother-in-law after giving birth. Kate introduced Prince George to the world in July 2013 wearing a short-sleeved blue dress by Jenny Packham that nodded to the polka-dot dress Princess Diana wore when leaving the hospital with Prince William three decades earlier.  Getty Images  When Princess Charlotte arrived in May 2015, Duchess Kate opted for another pastel Jenny Packham number, but this time her yellow dress in a buttercup print had longer sleeves to accommodate for the cooler spring weather just like the red dress did today.  Getty Images  Princess Charlotte also wore a knit cap when she went out into the world for the first time, while Prince George enjoyed the July weather sans-hat on his first outing. Both royal babies were swaddled in a white G.H. Hurt & Son soft wool baby shawl.  The first public appearances of Prince George (L) and Princess Charlotte (R). Getty Images  Since the weather in London was rather cold and windy today, the new prince also wore a knit cap and what appears to be the same G.H. Hurt & Son baby shawl as his siblings.  Getty Images  The previous two times Duchess Kate stepped out with her newborns she wore light-colored heels, but her Dune sling-back espadrilles were better suited for the July weather than the leather Jimmy Choo pumps she wore to introduce Charlotte.  Getty Images  Duchess Kate went for neutral shoes once again with baby no. 3, opting to re-wear what appears to be her Gianvito Rossi “Gianvito 105” pumps in taupe suede.  Getty Images  Prince George also made an appearance at the hospital when his little sister Charlotte was born, just like his dad Prince William did to greet Prince Harry.

This time around George didn’t match with his father, since he came straight from school wearing his uniform. Charlotte, however, was dressed for the occasion in a blue floral Liberty print dress and stole the crowd's heart by showing off her royal wave, while Prince George was a little more shy this time around.\n",

            "text: Bethany Minelle, News Reporter  Prince Harry - the world's most eligible bachelor - and Hollywood starlet Meghan Markle are getting married.  Hundreds will attend. Millions will watch on television - including coverage on Sky News and Sky 1. The event will go down in history.  Sky News will broadcast live in Windsor the week before the wedding with all the build-up to the big day, with exclusive live coverage of the wedding in UHD in a special programme ‪from 9am to 3pm‬ on Sky News and Sky One ‪on Saturday 19 May.  Image: Prince Harry and Meghan announced their engagement to the public in November  The couple say they want it to be \"a big shared event\" that is \"modern, inclusive but still adhering to tradition\", and they want \"everyone\" to be part of their big day.  So what can we expect from the Royal wedding?  When?  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will get married on Saturday 19 May, at noon.  Guests will arrive between 9.30am and 11am, with members of the Royal family to turn up from 11.20am.  They will enter St George's Chapel via the Galilee Porch, some on foot and others by car, while Ms Markle and her mother will begin their journey from the bride's overnight location.  Image: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will marry the couple  Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby - who baptised Meghan in March - will officiate the service, which will take around an hour.  It will be televised from start to finish and will be followed by a carriage procession starting at 1pm and lasting for about half an hour.  1:32 Video: When Harry met Meghan  The main part of the parade will pass along The Long Walk - a two-and-a-half mile (4km) path that links Windsor Castle with Snow Hill in Windsor Great Park.  The inspiration for the procession is believed to have come from the wedding of Prince Edward and the Countess of Wessex who got married at St George's chapel in 1999.  Where?  The couple will tie the knot on the High Altar of St George's Chapel, a 15th Century church on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Image: The pair sought the Queen's permission to wed in George's Chapel  One of the first things they will hear as a married couple will be a fanfare from 20 silver-plated trumpets.  After the service, Prince Harry and Meghan will leave the chapel through the west entrance and embark on a carriage parade through the town.  Image: They make their vows on the on the High Altar of St George’s Chapel  The steps of the chapel will be lined by members of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, and members of the Queen's Guard Windsor Castle will line the streets within Windsor Castle.  Bank holiday  Members of the Royal Family normally get married in the week, but as Prince Harry and Meghan are getting married on a Saturday, there won't be a bank holiday.  Image: The Diamond Jubilee in June 2012 was a bank holiday  Despite not getting a day off work, there is some good news for well-wishers - pubs will be open late over the wedding weekend.  The wedding falls on the same day as the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium, but with the cup final not expected to kick off until around 5.30pm, it is unlikely to clash with the royal big day.  Pubs, bars and other licensed premises will be allowed to keep serving until 1am, instead of the usual 11pm, on the nights of Friday 18 May and the following night, after the wedding.  Security  The wedding operation will be \"amongst the largest in Thames Valley Police's history\", with up to 100,000 people expected on the streets.  Image: There was a heavy police presence for the wedding of Prince William and Kate  Measures will include barriers to prevent vehicle attacks, armed police patrols and airport-style security searches.  Police dogs, mounted police and the National Police Air Service will all be used in the run up to the wedding, and on the day itself visitors may be stopped and checked and British Transport Police will be patrolling train stations and carriages.  Thames Valley, British Transport Police, the Metropolitan Police and Surrey Police will all be involved in policing the event.  Wedding invites  The gilded invites, printed by Bernard and Westwood, were made using American ink on English card and feature the three-feathered badge of Prince Charles in gold ink.  Image: The invitations follow many years of Royal tradition and have been made by @BarnardWestwood. They feature the Three-Feathered Badge of the Prince of Wales printed in gold ink. Pic: Kensington Palace  Guests  Unlike the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, which was held in Westminster Cathedral with 3,000 guests, this will be a much more intimate event.  Approximately 600 guests have been invited to the ceremony.  Additionally, 2,640 people have been invited to celebrate inside the castle walls. They won't be part of the congregation, but will all receive a sausage roll and a cup of tea.  Image: Palace aides have said the wedding will be a moment of 'fun and joy'  The guest list will include 1,200 young people and others who have served their communities and shown strong leadership, 200 people from charities and organisations that the couple have a close association with, and 100 pupils from two local schools.  The couple have asked that people be chosen from a broad range of backgrounds and ages.  Windsor Castle community members and members of the Royal households and Crown Estate have also been invited.  One couple told Sky what it was like to receive the \"Hogwarts-style\" invite.  Who's in?  This is a closely guarded secret, and Kensington Palace has issued no formal guestlist to the press or public.  Image: Queen Elizabeth II has given her formal approval to Harry and Meghan  As Prince Harry's grandmother and head of state, the Queen will certainly be there.  All close members of the Royal Family will also be in attendance, along with close friends of the happy couple.  Some foreign royals, senior figures from UK establishments, the church and select politicians - both British and foreign - could also attend.  With Hollywood starlet Meghan Markle as the bride, a host of sparkling celebrities are also expected to attend (see Celebrities).  Who's out?  :: The President of the United States  There has been much speculation over whether Donald Trump will attend the ceremony.  Image: US President Donald Trump said he hadn't heard about an invite  A past critic of the American President, Meghan Markle formerly called him \"divisive\" and a \"misogynist\".  When asked at the beginning of the year by Piers Morgan whether he had received an invite Mr Trump said, \"not that I know of\".  In an uncharacteristically gracious tone Mr Trump went on: \"I want them to be happy. I really want them to be happy. They look like a lovely couple.\"  :: Estranged members of Meghan's family  An only child, Meghan has two half-siblings on her father Thomas Markle's side.  2:06 Video: Royal wedding: Meet the Markles  Her extended family also includes a host of members from whom she appears to be estranged.  While her mother - Doria Ragland - and father are both expected to be at the ceremony, it is not known how many other members of Meghan's extended family will be present (see Meghan's family).  Image: Meghan's half-sister Samantha Markle  Meghan's half-sister, Samantha Markle, who is penning a tell-all book on the family entitled The Diary of Princess Pushy's sister, looks like she may have written herself out of an invite.  It remains to be seen how many of Meghan's family make it to the ceremony, but one thing is for certain - Prince Harry's family is set to outnumber the Markle clan to a massive degree.  :: The ex-husband  Meghan's ex-husband, Hollywood film producer Trevor Engelson, is also unlikely to be there.  Image: Trevor Engelson was married to Meghan for two years  The couple divorced in 2013 after two years of marriage citing \"irreconcilable differences\".  New Royal baby  Prince William and Kate had their third child on 23 April 2018, just less than a month before the wedding.  Image: Kate will give birth to the Royal baby in April - the month before the wedding  The newborn prince has knocked his uncle - Prince Harry - off his spot as fifth in line to the throne, pushing him down the pecking order to number six.  Kensington Palace have said that Prince Louis, who will be just weeks old, will not be attending the wedding.  Celebrities  The fact that Meghan is an actress means there will be plenty of showbiz faces to spot during the day.  Image: Sarah Rafferty is one of Meghan's closest friends on the set of Suits  For starters, a fair few of the Suits cast could be there including Meghan's co-stars Patrick J Adams, Gabriel Macht and Sarah Rafferty.  Tennis star Serena Williams, singer-songwriter Elton John and former footballer David Beckham are all likely to be present.  Image: The Spice Girls are rumoured to have received an invite  Rumour has it that the Spice Girls - Victoria Beckham, Geri Horner, Emma Bunton, Mel B and Melanie Chisholm - may all have received invites to the wedding.  Additionally, Millie Mackintosh, of Made In Chelsea fame, may well be there, with the pair previously having spent time together at an Oxfordshire spa and Millie rumoured to have been invited to Meghan's top secret hen do.  Meghan's family  Meghan's parents, who divorced when she was six, are expected to be at the wedding.  Meghan's mum, Doria Ragland, 61, is a yoga teacher and social worker who lives in California.  Image: Meghan with her mother Doria Ragland  Meghan's dad, Thomas Markle, 73, a retired TV lighting director now lives in a seaside town in Mexico.  It is possible that Meghan's half-brother, Thomas Markle Jr, could also be part of the congregation.  It is less likely that her half-sister Samantha Markle will be there (see Who's out).  Image: Meghan with her father Thomas Markle  However, Ashleigh - Samantha's daughter - who is estranged from her mother and said to be on good terms with Meghan, could be on the guest list.  Meghan's uncle on her mother's side, graphic designer Joffrey Ragland, 34, may well be in attendance.  It is unlikely that Meghan's pet beagle Guy, who moved from Toronto to London with her, will be coming along to help the couple celebrate, although he could rock up at the evening reception.  1:55 Video: Meghan: Campaigner and Trump critic  The flowers  The Royal wedding flowers will be designed by self-taught luxury floral designer Philippa Craddock.  Image: Florist Philippa Craddock will create the floral displays for the wedding  Arrangements will feature white garden roses - one of Princess Diana's favourite flowers - and peonies - believed to be a favourite of Meghan's.  Branches of beech, birch and hornbeam will also feature in the floral displays, which will reflect \"wild and natural landscapes\".  After the wedding the blooms will be given to different charities.  Dress code  The dress code for guests attending the ceremony is uniform, morning coat or lounge suit, or a day dress with a hat.  Best man  Officially there is no such thing as a best man at a Royal wedding, which instead uses the term \"supporters\".  Image: Will Prince William 'support' his little brother?  However, William was asked to be best man, as Harry was his for his big brother's wedding in 2011.  However, Harry did not exactly rush to ask his big brother to help him out on his big day...  2:02 Video: Prince Harry has not asked William to be his best man... yet  When asked about the possibility of being best man or supporter in January, William responded: \"He hasn't asked me yet… So, it could be a sensitive issue.\"  The Bridesmaids  Some of Meghan Markle's celebrity best friends are being touted as possible bridesmaids - among them tennis ace Serena Williams, actress and UNICEF ambassador Priyanka Chopra and British reality TV star Millie Mackintosh.  Image: Maid of honour Pippa Middleton leads the flower girls and page boys down the aisle  But while one of her pals may be chosen as maid of honour, none of them are likely to make the cut as Meghan's bridesmaid.  This is because unless Prince Harry and Meghan break with tradition, the precedent is to have children as attendants.  The flower girls are likely to be chosen from the children of the Royal Family - Princess Charlotte, who will be three by the time of the wedding, the children of Prince Harry's cousins Mia Tindall, three, Isla Phillips, five, and Savanna Phillips, seven, are among the most likely to be picked.  Image: William and Kate with their bridesmaids and pageboys on the day of their wedding  Children of some of Meghan's closest pals - including the daughter of stylist Jessica Mulroney Ivy Mulroney, four, and brand curator Benita Litt's two little daughters who Meghan has called her \"fairy god-daughters\" - may also be contenders.  In the offing to be page boys are third in line to the throne Prince George, four, and Jessica Mulroney's twin boys Brian and John, both seven.  Image: Flower girl Grace van Cutsem is not a fan of Royal weddings  While it is likely that Grace van Cutsem - the frowning flower girl at Prince William and Kate's wedding - will be at the wedding, she is unlikely to be a flower girl this time, despite her scene-stealing performance on the Buckingham Palace balcony during Will and Kate's first kiss.  Something borrowed  There are rumours that Meghan may wear the same tiara Princess Diana wore on her wedding day to Prince Charles.  Image: Princess Diana wearing the Spencer tiara in Australia in 1983  Known as the Spencer Tiara, it has not been worn in public since Diana's death.  Meghan's engagement ring is also made out of diamonds made from a bracelet which belonged to Princess Diana (see The Ring).  The dress  This is top secret, with much speculation over whether Meghan will go traditional, or step out in something with a more modern twist.  Image: Meghan in white at Westminster Abbey in March  Her stylist bestie Jessica Mulroney is said to have assisted her in picking a designer.  Designers in the frame include Erdem, Ralph & Russo, Roland Mouret, Inbal Dror and Jenny Packham.  Alexander McQueen - who designed Kate Middleton's lace wedding dress - is also a frontrunner.  Another stylist friend, Misha Nonoo, is also rumoured to be creating something bespoke for Meghan to wear at the evening reception.  1:34 Video: The Pledge: Can Meghan survive 'The Firm'?  Talking about her character in Suits, ahead of her engagement to Prince Harry, Meghan told Glamour magazine: \"I personally prefer wedding dresses that are whimsical or subtly romantic.\"  Meghan also said that she loved a \"low, ballerina inspired neckline\".  Her first wedding dress - for her marriage to Trevor Engelson in 2011 - was a white, floor-length strapless gown with a sparkling embellished belt to add a touch of colour.  As a former soldier, Prince Harry - who is now Captain General of Royal Marines - may be in uniform for the ceremony.  Down the aisle  Meghan's father, Thomas Markle, was due to walk his daughter down the aisle.  There was much initial speculation over whether the 73-year-old - who is said to value his privacy and keeps out of the limelight - would carry out the duty on the big day.  Image: Will Thomas Markle walk his daughter down the aisle?  Although Kensington Palace confirmed his attendance, his poor health has meant he has had to drop out, so he can recover from heart surgery.  Instead, Ms Markle will walk through the Nave of the chapel with her pageboys and bridesmaids and then be joined by Prince Charles at the Quire.  Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, 61, will also be at the wedding, and will travel with her daughter by car to Windsor Castle.  Diana tribute  Prince Harry is keen to involve Princess Diana's family in the wedding.  Image: Princess Diana will be remembered during the ceremony  All three of his mother's siblings - Lady Jane Fellowes, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Earl Spencer - will be attending.  Lady Fellowes will give a reading during the ceremony in celebration of her life.  The music  The couple have chosen musicians including a Christian gospel choir, a teenage cellist and a Welsh soprano to sing at the ceremony.  Image: Karen Gibson and The Kingdom Choir will be performing at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle  Kensington Palace said: \"Both Prince Harry and Ms Markle have taken a great interest and care in choosing the music for their service, which will include a number of well-known hymns and choral works.\"  Cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, the BBC Young Musician of 2016, said he was \"bowled over\" when Meghan called him personally to ask him to play in the chapel during the wedding.  The rings  Meghan's wedding ring will most likely be Welsh gold - a tradition the Royal Family have held since 1923.  Image: Meghan Markle shows off her engagement ring  It is not known whether Harry will choose to wear a ring or not - his brother Prince William shunned a ring, while his father Prince Charles wears a gold band.  Meghan's all-diamond, yellow gold engagement ring was designed by Prince Harry.  The large central diamond was sourced from Botswana - a country the couple have twice visited together - and the two smaller side stones have been taken from a £100,000 ($140,000) diamond bracelet that belonged to Princess Diana.  0:34 Video: Diana would be 'over the moon, so excited'  Prince Harry said the inclusion of his mother's stones was \"to make sure that she's with us on this crazy journey together\".  The engagement ring is estimated to be worth upwards of £35,000 ($50,000).  Royal kiss  The eagerly awaited first public kiss from the married couple will take place after the ceremony but before the carriage parade.  Image: Charles and Diana kiss on the balcony of Buckingham Palace  One of the defining moments of the wedding, it is likely to take place on the west steps of St George's Chapel.  Prince William and Kate had their first kiss, following their wedding in Westminster Abbey, on the balcony at Buckingham Palace, mirroring the kiss of Prince Charles and Diana after their wedding in St Paul's Cathedral.  The Photographer  The official Royal photographer on Prince Harry and Meghan's big day will be Alexi Lubomirski - the same man who took their engagement photos.  Image: Alexi Lubomirski will be capturing the official Royal wedding images for Prince Harry and Meghan  No stranger to royalty -\"His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski\" to use his full title - is himself of royal lineage, having descended from an influential Polish family who received their hereditary title in the 17th century.  Lubomirski, 42, who has snapped the likes of Beyonce, Gwyneth Paltrow and Nicole Kidman, has said he is thrilled to be witnessing \"the next chapter in this wonderful love story\".  The reception  The wedding will be followed by not one, but two receptions.  Image: The interior of St George's Hall where the first reception will be held  The first, which is being hosted by the Queen, will be a lunch for the 600 people who attended the wedding ceremony and will be held at St George's Great Hall.  Later that evening, the second reception, hosted by Prince Charles, will be held in the grounds of Frogmore House.  Image: The second reception will be held in Frogmore House  The venue near Windsor Castle was also the location for the couple's engagement photos.  Musical acts performing at the reception have yet to be confirmed, but they will no doubt be star names.  Image: An official engagement shot taken in the Frogmore House gardens. Pic: Alexi Lubomirski  Ed Sheeran, The Spice Girls, James Blunt and Ellie Goulding are all potential candidates.  The cake  The Royal wedding cake will be lemon and elderflower flavour, covered in buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.  Image: Pastry chef Claire Ptak will make the couple's wedding cake  Prince Harry and Meghan wanted the cake to incorporate the \"bright flavours of spring\" for their May wedding.  It will be made by American pastry chef Claire Ptak, who runs Violet Cakes in Hackney - an organic hipster bakery in east London.  The price of the cake is unknown, with the bakery website stating that \"wedding cakes are priced on request\".  The gifts  Prince Harry and Meghan have asked guests and well-wishers not to get them wedding gifts, but instead to donate money to charity.  Image: Wedding gifts are being eschewed in place of donations to charity  The seven charities they have chosen reflect their joint passions including sport for social change, women's empowerment, conservation, the environment, homelessness, HIV and the Armed Forces.  The organisations selected are CHIVA (Children's HIV Association), Crisis, the Myna Mahila Foundation, Scotty's Little Soldiers - a charity for bereaved Armed Forces children, StreetGames, Surfers Against Sewage, and The Wilderness Foundation UK.  Information on how to make donations is on the Royal Family website, with links to each of the charity's websites to make it as easy as possible to give money.  The honeymoon  No location has been confirmed, but if tradition is anything to go by, these three locations are in with a good chance:  :: Botswana, Africa  Just a few weeks into their relationship Prince Harry and Meghan \"camped out with each other under the stars\" here.  Image: Prince Harry and Prince William visit Botswana in 2015  The couple returned for Meghan's 36th birthday later that year.  Prince Harry, who visited Botswana with Prince William and Prince Charles shortly after Diana's death, has called the South African country his \"second home\".  :: Seychelles  Image: Prince William and Kate honeymooned in the Seychelles  Prince William and Kate spent their honeymoon here, enjoying 10 days of sun, sand and local wildlife.  Kate and Wills rented the secluded private North Island to avoid the frenzied media speculation around their vacation.  :: Broadlands, Hampshire  Image: Broadlands, Hampshire, is a Royal honeymoon favourite  This 18th century English country house is a favourite honeymoon destination for the royals, enjoyed by the Queen and Prince Philip after their wedding in 1947, and Prince Charles in 1981 after his wedding to Diana.  Prince Charles returned in 2005 with his second wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.  The couple will not go immediately go on their honeymoon, which Meghan is said to be paying for as a gift to Harry.  Royal titles  Despite marrying Prince Harry, Meghan will not become Princess Meghan. For that title she would have had to be born into the Royal family.  If Prince Harry retains his current rank as His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales, Meghan will become HRH Princess Henry of Wales.  21:07 Video: Harry and Meghan's relationship - in their words  However, if Prince Harry is promoted to the vacant role of Duke of Sussex - as it is widely expected he will be - Meghan will become HRH Duchess of Sussex.  Other available titles are the Duke of Clarence and the Duke of Buckingham.  Royal coin  The Royal Mint have designed a commemorative coin to celebrate Prince Harry and Meghan's marriage.  Image: Various versions of the coin are available  The coin shows the couple \"looking lovingly into each other's eyes\" in a \"relaxed and informal\" setting.  An uncirculated version of the coin is priced at £13, a silver proof coin is on sale for £82.50, and the gold proof version will set you back £1,980.  Memorabilia  The Royal Collection Trust has released an official Prince Harry and Meghan china collection which will be sold at the Queen's Gallery shop at Buckingham Palace.  Image: The choice of Royal wedding memorabilia is mind boggling  The blue and white china Royal wedding commemorative range which includes tea cups, coffee mugs, tankards, pillboxes and plates all decorated with the couple's initials painted in 22 carat gold.  Ceramics designer Emma Bridgwater has also created two bone china half-pint mugs at her Stoke-on-Trent factory to celebrate the wedding, one with the Royal crest and the other with the words \"Game changers, Free Spirits, Big hearts and Well Suited\".  Unofficial commemorative merchandise - of varying degrees of quality - are being sold across the world include tea-towels, dress-the-paper doll book and car bumper stickers.  What next?  Prince Harry previously told Sky News he was keen to settle down and start a family but said \"there's a process that one has to go through\".  0:28 Video: Prince Harry talks about settling down in 2015  Now that \"process\" has begun, bookies have begun taking bets on when Meghan and Harry will become proud parents, with the odds of a 2019 or 2020 Royal baby looking good.  When visiting Northern Ireland together in March, the pair met a husband and wife team who make baby products such as hypoallergenic Moses baskets and non-slip baths. Meghan joked \"I'm sure at some point we'll need the whole lot.\"  Image: Prince Harry and his fiancée Meghan Markle meeting well-wishers as they leave Brixton  Watch this space…\n",

            "text: When members of the royal family tie the knot, there’s a lot at stake—including a whole lot of money. Which is why it might be surprising to some onlookers that, according to the Daily Mail, Prince Harry has declined to seek a prenuptial agreement before he marries Meghan Markle today in Windsor. But we spoke to two royal experts who said nobody should be shocked at this news. When it comes to the royals, prenups are simply not done.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  This is not a celebrity marriage, it’s a royal marriage.  “I don’t think members of the royal family sign prenuptial agreements,” says Katie Nicholl, author of Harry: Life, Loss, and Love. “It’s commonplace with celebrity marriage, but this is not a celebrity marriage, it’s a royal marriage.” Nicholl says that Prince William and Kate Middleton also did not sign a prenuptial agreement, despite the very public divorce between William and Harry’s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana. And even though three of the Queen’s four children have divorced, none apparently had a prenuptial agreement.  Yes, there is a large sum of money in the balance for this marriage, but the true, staggering wealth belongs to the Queen, so it wouldn’t be divided up if Meghan and Harry did end up divorcing. “You wouldn’t need a prenuptial agreement to stop Windsor Castle from being cut in half in the event they divorce, because it’s not Harry’s,” says Duncan Larcombe, author of Prince Harry: The Inside Story.  Larcombe notes that Harry does have substantial wealth on his own, thanks to his inheritance from Princess Diana, but the Queen holds the vast majority of the royal property and fortune. The Queen's net worth has been estimated at around $500 million, while Prince Harry's is estimated anywhere from $25 to $40 million. Meghan also has her own money as a successful actress on Suits, reportedly making around $50,000 per episode of the long-running series.  If Meghan and Harry do ever divorce, Larcombe adds, the vast majority of negotiations would happen outside of court. For example, Diana received a new title, a financial settlement, and was entitled to royal security protection, although she turned that down. Plus, the Daily Mail notes that even though prenups are taken into account in U.K. divorces, they’re not legally enforceable.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  And though royal divorces may have had a violent start, thanks to Henry VIII’s habit for decapitation, royal splits try to make as few waves as possible in modern times. “In the modern history of the royal family, the divorce is described as amicable for PR reasons,” Larcombe says, “and the person who is departing the royal family, they’re just looked after, and those arrangements are not done through court, they’re done behind closed doors.”\n",

FameFlynet/BACKGRID  An appearance at the games would be the first time Markle accompanies Harry while he carries out official royal duties. Kensington Palace has not confirmed Markle’s attendance.  This year’s Invictus Games in Toronto will feature 550 competitors from 17 nations. They will compete in 12 different sports, from powerlifting to cycling and wheelchair rugby.  All 550 of the competitors are active duty and veteran service members who \"have become ill or injured during or as a direct consequence of their service,\" according to the games’ website.  The athletes will be supported by 1,500 volunteers. A focus this year is on the family and friends who support service members' journey to recovery.  ??

            "text: All eyes were on Meghan Markle Saturday as she walked down the aisle — and finally revealed her dress — at her internationally anticipated wedding to Prince Harry in Windsor, England.  The 36-year-old American actress paired a Givenchy gown with a tiara from Queen Elizabeth and a 16-foot veil detailed with flowers from all 53 countries in the British Commonwealth.  Prince Harry looks at Meghan Markle, as she arrives accompanied by the Prince of Wales in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, May 19, 2018. Jonathan Brady—PA Wire  While using Givenchy, a French fashion house, was unexpected, Clare Waight Keller designed Markle’s wedding dress. The British designer was Givenchy’s first female artistic director last year, Kensington Palace announced.  Markle’s dress featured an open bateau neckline and a triple silk organza underskirt, according to Kensington Palace. And though no price has been publicly released, we do have an idea about how much custom Givenchy dresses cost: When Kim Kardashian wore one at her 2014 wedding to Kanye West, it was valued at $500,000.  Samantha Brown, a New York-based celebrity stylist, tells MONEY that although the dress may initially appear simple, the fabric and tailoring likely drove the cost up.  “The gown is exquisite in its fit, and the fabric drapes perfectly,” she says. “While it isn’t beaded or embellished, two components that always signify ‘expensive,’ the attention to detail and, of course, Givenchy price tag surely make this gown extremely lux.”  Dawn Del Russo, a fashion expert and founder of Bella Dawn, says Markle’s wedding dress has an “absolutely American princess feel.” “Haute couture gowns like this can be priced as high as $340,000,” she adds. “Safe to say her couture designer gown that will be marked in history is in the hundreds of thousands.”  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle during their wedding service, conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in Windsor, Britain, May 19, 2018. Owen Humphreys—Pool/Reuters  The ceremony caps off weeks of speculation about who would design Markle’s wedding dress, what it would look like and how much it would cost. Many of the rumors were linked to a comment Markle made about her favorite wedding gown of all time: the one Carolyn Bessette Kennedy wore at her 1996 ceremony, a slip dress the New York Times that was about $40,000 back then. Others were inspired by her Suits character, Rachel Zane. When Markle-as-Zane got married on TV, she wore a $6,800 Anne Barge creation in the Versailles style.  Similarly, the wedding dress Markle’s sister-in-law — Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge — wore when she wed Prince William in 2011 was also fiercely debated. Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding dress was the subject of much debate when she wed Prince William back in 2011. Whereas royals aficionado Katie Nicholl told Entertainment Tonight this past March that Kate’s parents paid £150,000 — about $203,000 — for the dress, the Daily Mail reported at the time that it cost £250,000 — about $338,000.  However, Nicholl did predict that Markle would avoid outdoing her sister-in-law.  “I think it was very unlikely that Meghan would spend more than that, and in doing so try and upstage a future queen,” she told ET.  But Markle didn’t have to worry about exceeding the budget of her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana. According to CBS News, Diana’s dress cost just $13,000. And Queen Elizabeth II paid for hers with coupons.\n",

            "text: One of the more romantic scenes in Lifetime's take on everyone's favorite royal duo, Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance, involves the wedding of someone the couple is only tangentially related to: Pippa Middleton, sister of Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge. In the made-for-TV movie, the almost-royal is excluded from a pretty significant Middleton family gathering (ahem, our girl Pippa's wedding ceremony) and as it turns out, the real Meghan Markle wasn't at Pippa's wedding ceremony, either — but she managed to make it to the reception.  In the movie, the fictional Markle is on the phone with her mother, slightly sad about being left out, when Harry bursts in to take her to the party after all — where she met Harry's parents for the first time. In the film, Kate Middleton blames her sister's \"no ring, no bring\" policy — meaning only engaged or married couples were allowed — for Markle being benched. (In real life and in the movie, Markle and the prince were not yet betrothed.)  As it turns out, this plus one policy was the real deal, but as PEOPLE noted, both James Middleton's longtime girlfriend Donna Air and Princess Eugenie's longtime boyfriend Jack Brooksbank attended the ceremony. Additionally, according to The Telegraph, Markle was fully invited to Middleton's May 2017 wedding despite the \"no ring no bring\" policy, but at the last moment Markle did not appear at the ceremony itself. So what gives?  The way PEOPLE told the story, Harry left after the ceremony and drove 90 minutes back to London to pick up his then girlfriend from Kensington Palace where she was cooped up. According to Vanity Fair, Markle had been seen in London before the wedding and everything seemed good to go. E! news reported that Markle skipped out of the ceremony so as not to draw attention to a wedding that was not her own and upstage the couple on their special day. (For the record, The Daily Beast was already speculating whether or not Markle would steal the show, as many once thought Pippa did at her sister's wedding, before the big day even arrived.) It's also possible there was concern that the paparazzi, who mobbed Markle at every chance, would make for unruly and unwelcome wedding guests. The Mirror speculates that it was always the plan for Markle to attend the reception, despite laying low for the wedding itself, and that Prince Harry's last-minute drive was simply so she wouldn't have to arrive alone. (Bustle reached out to Kensington Palace for comment but did not hear back.)  courtesy of Lifetime  Unfortunately for that wasn't the end of the drama. There was still some slight scandal when The Mirror reported that Markle's black dress and white cape was a sombre fashion faux pas for a wedding reception. The Lifetime movie leaves this bit out, making Markle's reception dress red, and any real life faux pas doesn't seem to have affected any permanent damage on Markle's relationship with the Royals in 2018.  Oh, but there's more: The wedding reception scene in the Lifetime movie takes additional steps to mix fiction with reality for the sake of drama by including a fictional relative named Lady Violet, who wears an offensive brooch to the wedding. The scene calls to mind a heated racist brooch trolling debacle — in which Princess Michael of Kent caught fire for wearing a blackamoor brooch, with an exotic and offensive depiction of an African person, to a luncheon attended by Markle. The Princess later apologized and claimed not to have worn something so offensive to Markle intentionally, but in the Lifetime movie, Harry warns this fictional Lady Violet about the same brooch, months before the luncheon would have taken place — which is a pretty shady twist on the real life story.  And look, there was probably a decent amount of actual family drama at Pippa's wedding — the Royals are humans, after all, and humans get dramatic at weddings. But clearly, the Lifetime movie plays up it all up for our amusement — likely far more than anything that actually happened in real life.\n",

            "text: The cover of Us Weekly this week features a Photoshopped composite of our pals Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, with an American flag floating just above Meghan’s head. “COMING TO AMERICA!” the cover line shouts (with the similarly all-caps question touted beneath: “BUT IS HER DAD ON THE LIST?”).  Yes, the magazine claims that, per a Palace insider, Harry and Meghan are in the midst of planning a U.S. tour in the spring of 2019 (their first full-scale overseas tour as a married couple is set for this October, when they will travel to Australia and New Zealand timed for the Invictus Games). “They are so excited to head to the U.S.” the insider told the magazine. “Meghan is looking forward to introducing Harry to everything she loves about the U.S.” (Feel free to begin searching through the entries from the Tig you printed and arranged in a scrapbook to start deducing to which eateries and boutiques Meghan might introduce her husband.)  Us Weekly has additional posited details it is offering up, as well, claiming that the duo are “thinking New York, Washington, D.C., and California,” though they are “working to finalize locations and venues.” In California, they will reportedly visit San Francisco, where “they will meet with C.E.O.s and female tech entrepreneurs to encourage their involvement in the industry.” (Perhaps Meghan can pitch some Silicon Valley types on a Tig-esque recommendations app; or Harry can offer some suggestions on . . . maybe a polo V.R. experience?) “Meghan and Harry want to solidify ties between the U.K. and the U.S.,” the source says. “They want to highlight and foster these relationships.” There might be a Chicago component, as well, involving a stop at the Obama Foundation. While this is starting to sound like a quite sprawling tour already, there is also apparently talk of extending it to Canada, where Meghan lived (in Toronto) while she was filming Suits, for seven seasons.  The royal-related rumors—particularly Meghan-related ones—come fast and furious these days, so it’s hard to know exactly how seriously to take this report. A trip that involves stops in New York City, D.C., San Francisco, Chicago, and Canada, seems somewhat insane; on the other hand, they will surely visit the U.S. at some point soon, especially since Meghan is from here. (The publication notes that Meghan will be making an “unofficial” solo trip to New York and Los Angeles later this summer “to see family and friends.” We can only imagine what sort of comments Thomas Markle will be making if that trip does not involve a stop to see him.)  Vanity Fair has reached out to the Palace for comment on the report.\n",

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Meghan Markle’s childhood best friend has revealed the real reason her first marriage broke up - and it wasn't a mutual decision.  Childhood pal Ninaki Priddy opened up about Prince Harry's fiancée, claiming her desire to be famous outweighed her commitment to her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson.  Meghan married her ex back in 2011 on a Jamaican beach. They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.  Ninaki says otherwise.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  \"The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,\" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,\" she told Mail Online.  Prior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.  \"Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There’s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.  The pair first met aged two at Hollywood’s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.  Following a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.  She explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.  (Image: Instagram)  Elsewhere, Ninaki said her former best friend, who quit Suits to pursue a life with Harry, always wanted to be famous.

She used to practise announcing herself.\"  While talking about her relationship with Harry and her role as a future royal, Ninaki claims Meghan was always very aware of the Royal Family - despite the actress claiming she knew little about Harry when they met.  \"I think it’s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.  \"I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana’s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.\"  She added: \"I wasn’t shocked or even surprised to hear about Prince Harry. I know she used to love The Princess Diaries — films about a commoner who becomes part of a Royal Family. She was very taken with that idea.\"\n",

            "text: Princess Elizabeth and Philip, Duke of Edinburgh pose on their wedding day on Nov. 20, 1947.  Britain, 1947. The Second World War had ended but the nation’s struggle was far from over.  Rationing was still in place for myriad food items. In the streets, people queued for jobs, for handouts and for fresh fruit. Families torn apart by war tried desperately to rebuild, many without the men who had left home for battle and never returned. Access to fuel was limited. Then one of the coldest winters on record hit, destroying Britain’s wheat crop and leaving thousands of people in rural areas isolated.  When Princess Elizabeth’s engagement to Philip Mountbatten was announced that summer, many Brits welcomed the news. After so much suffering, the prospect of a royal wedding seemed to lift the nation’s spirit. “Oh, it gave us all a boost,” recalled Pat Bannell, a 97-year-old from East London. “We were all for it, especially if we got a day off work,” she said, chuckling.  The wedding of the future Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip came just four months after the engagement and was attended by 2,000 guests.  Across the country and around the world, people listened to the events unfold on the radio. Thousands gathered on the streets of London and outside Buckingham Palace, where they waited patiently for hours to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds after the nuptials. As the couple stepped out onto the balcony and waved, they were met with a roar of whistling, claps and cheers.  Describing the “vast crowds” and “shining happiness of the bride,” the Daily Telegraph reported the wedding would “live long in the memory.”  On Saturday, those long-ago newlyweds — the queen is now 92, Prince Philip is 96, and the couple celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary in November — are expected to attend the royal wedding of their grandson Prince Harry to American actress Meghan Markle. (Prince Philip is recovering from a hip operation.)  [Britain’s black queen: Will Meghan Markle really be the first mixed-race royal?]  Planning any wedding is stressful — and mishaps are inevitable. Just ask Queen Elizabeth. On the morning of her wedding, the jewel-encrusted fringe tiara she was given as her “something borrowed” by her mother snapped as it was placed atop her head. The royal family, of course, had a jeweler on standby who was able to repair it and save the day.  Elizabeth’s wedding cake was nine-feet tall, and she received 10,000 telegrams of congratulations. The material for the wedding gown was purchased with ration coupons collected by the bride. Members of the public who wanted to help had sent their own coupons for the princess to use, although these were kindly returned to the senders.  Elizabeth’s dress was made from ivory silk and embellished with 10,000 pearls. But royal wedding dresses have not always been white. Before the 19th century, many royal brides opted for color, the bolder and brighter the better. When Queen Victoria wore a white ball gown to marry Prince Albert in 1840, she changed wedding traditions — royal and commoner — forever.    An illustration of the Feb. 10, 1840, wedding of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in the Chapel Royal at St. James’s Palace in England. (Associated Press)  The demands of history always play a role in royal weddings. Not only do couples need consent from the queen to marry, they must also deal with an additional layer of pressure: to follow or jettison age-old traditions.  When the bride and groom exchange vows at Windsor Castle’s St. George’s Chapel this weekend, comparisons with the past will certainly be made. Kensington Palace announced this week that Markle’s father will not walk her down the aisle, as tradition demands. Instead she asked Prince Charles, her father-in-law, to perform the honor.  A statement from Ms. Meghan Markle: pic.twitter.com/TjBNarmuBU — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 17, 2018  Not having her father escort her isn’t without precedent. Queen Victoria was accompanied to the altar by her uncle. And Victoria walked her own daughter, Princess Beatrice, down the aisle in 1885.  On Saturday, smaller dramas will revolve around the royal couple’s decorative choices, sentimental touches and ceremonial decisions. All will be scrutinized. While many customs have prevailed throughout royal wedding history, others have been tweaked or replaced entirely.  The vows  When Elizabeth married Prince Philip in 1947, she took a traditional vow, promising to “love, cherish and obey” him.  It was Diana, Princess of Wales who broke with tradition in 1981 when she married Prince Charles by omitting the word obey. Diana instead promised to “love, comfort, honor and keep” her new husband.  Diana’s decision sparked controversy not just at home but also overseas. “LADY DIANA WON’T VOW TO OBEY CHARLES,” the New York Times wrote.    Princess Diana and Prince Charles on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after their wedding on July 29, 1981. (AP Photo)  [Diana’s final hours: Dodi’s yacht, a Ritz suite, a diamond ring and relentless photographers]  Royal brides who came after Diana did not follow suit. When Sarah Ferguson married Prince Andrew in 1986, she vowed to obey, as did Sophie Rhys-Jones during her wedding to Prince Edward. (Bishop of Norwich Peter Nott, who led the wedding service, said use of the word ‘obey’ was about trust and did not mean Sophie was going to be “subservient.”)  In the run-up to Kate Middleton’s wedding to Prince William in 2011, speculation was rife about the impending vows. Would Kate do a Diana? The answer was yes. Standing in Westminster Abbey, she vowed to “love, comfort, honor and keep” her husband, with no mention of obeying him.  Now it is Meghan Markle’s turn to decide.  Flowers  When it comes to flowers and royal weddings, arrangements are traditionally all white — although size and style have varied dramatically over time.  Kate’s bouquet was described as simple by some and underwhelming by others. Diana’s bridal arrangement was quite the opposite, weighing in at more than four pounds. The bouquet was ostentatious, and she did not just have one, she had two. This is rumored to be because Elizabeth’s was allegedly misplaced by a footman and went missing at some point during her wedding day — much to the dismay of the official photographer. When it came time to take the family photo, her arrangement was nowhere to be seen.    Elizabeth’s bouquet was missing in this family portrait. (Associated Press)  Despite the differences in size, flower selection and personal preference, the inclusion of myrtle, which symbolizes love, is a tradition that dates back to the wedding of Queen Victoria’s daughter and is expected to continue with Meghan this weekend, although many anticipate she will add her own touch to the creation.  Wedding rings    Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon with Britain’s Duke of York, who became King George VI, on April 26,1923. (Associated Press)  At the time of her marriage to the future King George VI in 1923, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, later known as the Queen Mother, opted for a wedding ring made from rare Welsh gold. From this date on, the Welsh wedding band became somewhat of a statement. Since then, the unique gold has been used to form the rings of the queen, Princess Margaret and Princess Diana. The wedding rings are formed from the same nugget, carefully extracted from the Clogau St. David’s gold mine in Wales. After his engagement, Prince William was given Welsh gold by the queen so Kate could wear a Welsh band.  Prince Harry recently said yellow gold is Meghan’s favorite, but it is not yet known whether her choice of wedding ring will follow royal tradition.  The date  Royal weddings often occur during the week, which, in the past has resulted in a day off for most workers. Queen Elizabeth and Philip were married on a Thursday. Prince Charles and Princess Diana on a Wednesday. Prince William and Catherine married on a Friday, and pubs and bars across the country had their opening hours extended to make room for extra drinking time.  Not only are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tying the knot on a Saturday, but it is also one of the biggest soccer matches of the year, the FA Cup final. For FA President Prince William, who is also Harry’s best man, it is shaping up to be quite the day.

            "text: Pippa Middleton knows what it’s like to have someone steal the spotlight at a wedding – in part, because she herself did exactly that at her own sister’s wedding. Lest some of you have forgotten, Pippa famously stole the thunder at Kate Middleton‘s wedding by wearing *that* dress, the one that all the tabloids and publications were talking about for weeks on end after the wedding was over. In fact, major publications spent more time covering Pippa’s dress than Kate’s actual wedding, a fact that did not go unnoticed by the royals or Kate.  Since then, Pippa’s been taking a much more low-key role in her relationship with the media and publicity, with exceptions every now and then. But because of her history at thunder-stealing, she understands how easy it is for attention at weddings to drift to someone other than the bride – and in this particular circumstance, it’s almost a given that it will happen to her.  According to recent reports, Pippa Middleton is worried that inviting Meghan Markle, Prince Harry’s beau, to her wedding will shift the attention away from her wedding and onto Meghan. As we saw a few days ago, Meghan Markle attended Prince Harry’s friend’s wedding in Jamaica, and all anyone in the media cared about the next few days was Meghan. And unfortunately, Pippa Middleton is clearly a lot more attention-hungry than Harry’s friends (who are reportedly generally down-to-earth), which means that she’s much less likely to want Meghan at her wedding.  Sources tell the Daily Mail that Pippa definitely noticed how events played out at the wedding in the Caribbean, explaining, “She saw how all eyes were on Meghan rather than Lara (the bride) last week. The situation was also stressful for Harry. Pippa and her mother Carole wonder whether Meghan’s presence could cause a great deal of unnecessary chaos.”  According to the same source, Pippa is now employing a “no ring, no guest” policy which will ensure that the only people who attend her wedding will be guests and their married spouses – which would essentially eliminate Meghan. However, being that it’s Prince Harry we’re talking about, you think he wouldn’t make his own rules on who he could bring? Can you imagine him NOT bringing Meghan Markle to his own sister-in-law’s wedding, given that he took her to a friend’s wedding?  What do you guys think?

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced their engagement a year ago today and a whole lot has happened since then.  Reuters 25 Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are celebrating the wedding anniversary of their engagement announcement today  The couple revealed that Harry had proposed on November 27, 2017, just over a year after Kensington Palace first confirmed their relationship.  Meghan, 37, and 34-year-old Harry married at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on May 19.  They're now expecting their first child together, due in spring.

The pair met in London several times, with Meghan papped in the Royal Box at Wimbledon, and in Los Angeles after Harry treated her to a weekend at his best friend’s house in the Hollywood Hills.

            "text: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” meaning that whatever she wears more or less sells out immediately across the globe. Some designer labels she has worn have had to double their staff just to keep up with demand after a photo of her in a particular outfit is published.  LONDON, ENGLAND - JUNE 17: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge look out from the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the Trooping the Colour parade on June 17, 2017 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  Her two older children, Prince George, 4, who is third in line for the throne, and Princess Charlotte, 2, also produce the “Prince George Effect” and the “Princess Charlotte Effect.” According to Brand Finance, Princess Charlotte could spur as much as $5 billion boost to the economy, with Prince George creating a slightly smaller economic impact, estimated to be around $3.6 billion. Their third royal baby could generate up to $1 billion for the British economy.  Correction: This article originally misstated Prince William dukedom. He and Kate Middleton are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, not the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall.\n",

            "text: Meghan Markle’s nephew has announced details of the special strain of cannabis he has created to celebrate the upcoming royal wedding.  Tyler Dooley grows cannabis in Oregon, US – which has been legal in the American state since 2015 – and previously announced that he would be developing a new potent hybrid named Markle’s Sparkle.  Now, days before Markle is due to marry Prince Harry, details of the drug’s price, flavour and effects have been released on Leaf Buyer – an online cannabis dispensary database.  In an online description of Markle Sparkle, the website says: “Noble families often inspire their country persons to craft and dedicate products to them.  “For a Royal baby, a royal cheddar. For a Royal wedding, a royal weed.  “Markle Sparkle is a cannabis strain dedicated to the soon-to-be British Royal Meghan Markle.”  The $150-an-ounce (£111) strain is tipped to be good for helping alleviate insomnia, pain and anxiety, and it has been specially engineered so that it doesn’t make users feel too hungry.  The website also says that Markle Sparkle has a “very sweet, silky taste” with “notes of fresh blueberry and a unique, fruity and smooth flavour.”  As for its effect, the drug is supposed to provide users with an “uplifting” experience and a “tingling body sensation.”  “There is a sense of relief and euphoria that comes with the high as well,” it says.  “These benefits make for a great all-around versatile strain for any medical patient or recreational consumer.”  The Markle Sparkle tests at 23 per cent THC - the active ingredient in marijuana – and is made by crossbreeding three varieties including NYC Diesel, Northern Lights with Blueberry and a secret strain which Dooley is not revealing.

On June 9, the newly minted Duchess of Sussex joined her husband, Prince Harry, and the entire royal family for the London festivities.

Though the royal newlywed appeared perfectly content riding in a carriage alongside Prince Harry and mingling with the royal family on the iconic balcony of Buckingham Palace, some detractors on social media felt that the look was “inappropriate” for the regal occasion.  “Off the shoulder is inappropriate day wear at the Trooping or any official engagement,” one critic clapped.  “I do feel her choice of an off the shoulder dress was pushing it for HRH Queen Elizabeth’s Birthday celebration. I have a feeling she’s going to push the limits a little too much?!” another agreed of the look another dubbed as \"wholly inappropriate.\"  Nevertheless, fans were quick to rush to Markle's defense.  “Meghan Markle broke protocol by wearing an off the shoulder dress. Keep doing you boo!” one fan applauded.  “Oh the humanity!! The crown is experiencing such unrest with two barely visible shoulders. Stop it!!” another exclaimed.  “The American Princess is the epitome of class, beauty and style. We love Meghan Markle,” one chimed in.  Meanwhile, another supporter cheekily pointed out that Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Diana and even Queen Elizabeth have all worn off the shoulder outfits, too.  In other style news, the Duchess of Cambridge, Camilla Parker-Bowles, and the Queen all wore long sleeved, blue ensembles for the Trooping of the Colour commencement.

            "text: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s love story plays out on the small screen in Lifetime’s Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance, which premieres on Sunday night.  From their first blind date to their cozy kitchen engagement, the TV movie captured many of the couple’s milestone moments — and Parisa Fitz-Henley and Murray Fraser’s uncanny resemblance to the real-life couple is worth a double take!  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  But what was real and what was just for show? Here’s a breakdown of the show’s major plot points. And, it goes without saying, spoilers ahead!  RELATED: Download PEOPLE’s The Story of Diana for intimate details, interviews with family and friends and exclusive home footage of Prince Harry and Prince William’s late mother  True: Prince Charles Took William and Harry to Africa After Their Mother’s Death  The first scene opens with brothers Prince William and Prince Harry traveling through Africa with their father, Prince Charles, just after Princess Diana’s death. In real life, Charles brought his sons there to escape the glare of the spotlight following their mother’s death on August 30, 1997. It was a formative trip for Harry, who fell in love with Africa during that time. “I first came in 1997, straight after my mum died. My dad told my brother and me to pack our bags — we were going to Africa to get away from it all,” Harry told Town & Country in 2017. “This is where I feel more like myself than anywhere else in the world. I wish I could spend more time in Africa. I have this intense sense of complete relaxation and normality here.”  Prince Philip, Prince William, Earl Spencer, Prince Harry and Prince Charles walk outside Westminster Abbey during the funeral service for Princess Diana JEFF J. MITCHELL/AFP/Getty  False: Prince Harry Was Deep Into the Party Scene Just Before Meeting Meghan  While it’s true that he was known as the party prince during his 20s, his partying days were well behind him by the time he met Meghan in 2016. In 2005, Harry’s picture was splashed on front pages around the world showing the then-20-year-old wearing a Nazi uniform at a costume party. He made headlines again after naked photos emerged from his strip billiards game in Las Vegas in 2012. But after retiring from the Army in 2015 after 10 years of service, Harry had reformed his wild ways. And he was ready to find love and settle down. “Harry’s drinking days are over,” a source told PEOPLE. “All of his best friends have settled and had children, so he’s had fewer people to go out and play with. He realized he was getting a bit older and that it was time to settle down a little bit.” Adds Duncan Larcombe, a former royals reporter who traveled with Prince Harry throughout much of the early 2000s: “He desperately wanted to get married and be happy. He sees his brother has found that. The fact that Meghan arrived when she did completes it for Harry.”  Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Owen Humphreys/PA Wire/AP  True: Meghan Took Issue with an Ivory Soap Commercial  The scene where Meghan was offended by a soap commercial geared towards women rings true. Meghan was inspired to change a TV commercial at the age of 11, after seeing a Procter & Gamble commercial that advertised its Ivory dishwashing soap solely to women. The commercial for the soap struck her as unfair and insensitive when she heard, “women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans.” Meghan’s social studies class had been assigned to watch commercials and assess them. The assignment led to a monumental moment for the future royal. Meghan decided to write to the company and asked them to change their slogan from “Women all over America” to “People all over America.” And her efforts paid off. The commercial aired on TV again, this time with the slogan, “People are fighting greasy pots and pans with Ivory care.” About 20 years after seeing the commercial, Meghan gave a speech about the moment at the United Nations, saying, “I remember feeling shocked and angry and also just feeling so hurt. It just wasn’t right and something needed to be done.  RELATED VIDEO: Harry and Meghan Confirm They Will Uphold a ‘Very Important’ Tradition Involving the Wedding Dress!  True: Meghan and Harry Were Set Up on a Blind Date  The newly-engaged couple revealed that they were set up on a blind date in July 2016 and knew very little about each other before they met. “It was definitely a set-up — it was a blind date,” Harry said during the couple’s revealing engagement interview. “It was a blind date for sure.” And as is shown in the movie, Meghan did ask their matchmaker whether Harry was “nice.” “I didn’t know much about him. And so the only thing that I had asked her when said she wanted to set us up was – I had one question, I said, ‘Well, is he nice?’ Because if he wasn’t kind it just didn’t – it didn’t seem like it would make sense,” Meghan said during their interview.  True: One of Their First Dates Was a Trip to Botswana  Unlike what was depicted in the movie, Meghan didn’t spend three days waiting for Harry to call her. In real life, Meghan and Harry’s first date was quickly followed by two back-to-back dates in London, so he was already on speed-dial by that point! But after those initial dates, they did travel together to Botswana. “It was I think about three, maybe four weeks later that I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana,” Harry said of their whirlwind romance. “And we camped out with each other under the stars. She came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic. So then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure that we had a chance to know each other.”  Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Prince Harry in Botswana Rhino Conservation Botswana/ Kensington Palace/Getty  False: Will and Kate Cautioned Harry About Dating Meghan  In the movie, Prince William and Kate Middleton aren’t overly supportive of Harry dating Meghan in the beginning and they express their concern over her background. But Meghan’s future in-laws have always been in the couple’s corner. “She’s been wonderful,” Meghan said of Kate after the couple’s engagement. Harry added: “Amazing, as has William as well, you know, fantastic support.” Meghan, who will be learning on the job, “is funny and serious and extremely hard-working,” a source close to the former Suits star told PEOPLE. “I can imagine Kate will find a great friend in her.”  Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Chris Jackson/Getty Images  False: Meghan Wasn’t Invited to Pippa Middleton’s Wedding Reception  While it’s true that Meghan didn’t receive an invite to Pippa’s wedding ceremony, she was invited to the black-tie reception that followed. Following the ceremony, a source told PEOPLE that Harry would travel back to London to pick Meghan up for the wedding reception in Bucklebury. The royal was spotted driving after the post-church Englefield House party. The fact that she did attend the wedding — even if it was the post-church nighttime bash — was yet another sign that the Suits actress and the prince were getting more and more serious.  True: A Royal Relative Wore an Offensive Brooch  While it didn’t happen at Pippa’s wedding as depicted in the movie, a royal relative did wear an offensive brooch to the Queen’s annual Christmas lunch, which was attended by Meghan in December 2017. Princess Michael of Kent, the wife of the Queen’s first cousin, was pictured arriving at Buckingham Palace wearing a brooch on her left shoulder which appeared to be “blackamoor” jewelry, depicting the bust of a black person with a gold crown and colorful crystals. The brooch drew further criticism due to Meghan’s biracial background (her mother is Black and her father is white) — and the fact that Princess Michael chose to wear it on the day Meghan was being introduced to many extended royal family members for the first time. Princess Michael of Kent released a statement following the incident that read: “The brooch was a gift and has been worn many times before. Princess Michael is very sorry and distressed that it has caused offense.”  Princess Michael of Kent Mark Cuthbert/UK Press/Getty  True: Harry and Meghan Wore Matching Bracelets  Just like in the movie, Harry did give Meghan a bracelet that matched his own. The couple started sporting “his and hers” jewelry early on in their relationship. They were spotted wearing the same blue beaded bracelet on several occasions. Prince Harry reportedly picked up the bracelet during one of his trips to Africa. And the gift rarely left the actress’s wrist! She even posted several photos on her now-deleted Instagram account showing off her sweet trinket.  Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty; Megan Markle/Instagram  True: Meghan Met the Queen  During Meghan and Prince Harry’s revealing engagement interview, the couple revealed that the L.A.-born actress had not only met the Queen a couple times already, she also immediately won over her dogs. “It’s incredible,” Meghan said about meeting the Queen. “To be able to meet her through his lens, not just with his honor and respect for her as Monarch, but with the love he has for her as his grandmother. She’s an incredible woman.” Harry then added: “The corgis took to her straight away. ‘I’ve spent the last 33 years being barked at — this one walks in, absolutely nothing.” And Meghan, who has two dogs herself, replied: “They were laying on my feet during tea!”  False: Harry’s Public Statement Led to a Breakup  While the movie insinuates that Meghan was in the dark about Harry’s rare public statement in November 2016 that confirmed that he was dating the actress and slammed what he called the racist and sexist abuse she had endured since their relationship was revealed, Meghan was most likely fully supportive of that decision. And it didn’t lead to a brief breakup as was depicted in the movie. Since it was such a rare move for a royal family member to release a statement about their private life, Meghan would have been briefed about the statement at length before it was released.  Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Alexi Lubomirski/REX/Shutterstock  False: A Member of Harry’s Inner Circle Tried to Intimidate Meghan  The character of Annabella, played by Marlie Collins, doesn’t exist in real life. But the royal interloper, who chided Meghan about her TV career, biracial background and even her biological clock, did represent a lot of the criticism the couple was facing when they took their relationship public.  True: Meghan’s Ex-Husband Is Producing a Show Based on Her Relationship with Prince Harry  Trevor Engelson, Meghan’s ex-husband, is producing an as-of-yet-untitled show with a premise that sounds awfully familiar — because it’s based on his own relationship with Meghan, and her relationship with Prince Harry. The description of the show reads: “Divorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London’s tabloid media, is next level,” according to Deadline. The idea came to be during a discussion between Engelson — who also works on FX’s Snowfall — and Dan Farah, another one of the show’s producers, where they imagined what life would have been like if Engelson and Markle had children, and he potentially had to share custody (and all the associated drama) with the royal family. Though the basis of the show was hatched from reality, Deadline does add that, “It should be noted that the comedy is fictional, the lead characters are not based on Markle or Engelson, who have no kids together, and she has had no involvement in the project.”  Queen Charlotte Indianapolis Museum of Art /Getty Images  True: Meghan Is Not the First Biracial Royal  Although it’s doubtful that the Queen showed Meghan a portrait of Queen Charlotte, a biracial royal, during her palace visit, she is, in fact, a real royal. Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was married to King George III and was queen for nearly 60 years, until she died in 1818. She’s the grandmother of Queen Victoria and the great-great-great-great-grandmother of the current Queen Elizabeth. Though she was born in Germany, the daughter of a Duke, Queen Charlotte was directly descended from Margarita de Castro y Sousa, which was the black branch of the Portuguese Royal House. Her racial background wasn’t known to the public when she served as queen. It was only discovered many years after her death, thanks to art historians who studied portraits of Charlotte more closely.\n",

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  The Duchess of Cambridge looked gorgeous in a 'cream' tailored coat by fashion favourite Alexander McQueen for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding at St George's Chapel, in Windsor.  Of course, it's the same designer who created Kate's wedding dress for her big day in April 2011.  Kate arrived at the service hand-in-hand with the bridesmaids, including daughter Princess Charlotte, 3, who were dressed in white with rose-adorned headbands.  She teamed her ensemble with a matching Philip Treacy hat and shoes by Jimmy Choo.  Though undeniably stunning, the Duchess' choice created a stir as wedding protocol dictates that only the bride wears white when tying the knot.

It's the fourth time Kate has worn this outfit, including to Charlotte's christening in July 2015  (Image: PA)  It’s one of the first times we’ve seen the Duchess of Cambridge in public since she gave birth to her third child Prince Louis on April 23.  Kate wore a red bespoke Jenny Packham dress with a white lace collar to introduce her baby boy to the world, as she and William left the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s Hospital.  She was also spotted on her way to Windsor two days before the wedding for the rehearsal, wearing sunglasses and a floral Michael Kors dress .

            "text: On Saturday, Prince Harry, 33, and Meghan Markle, 36, will wed at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle in a ceremony officiated by . . . sorry, we almost fell asleep there. We know all those details. You know what’s much more fun to discuss than wedding logistics? Wedding drama.  And unlike many royal weddings, there has been no shortage of it, especially in the last week. Here’s all the gossip leading up to the year’s most anticipated nuptials:  What’s up with Meghan’s dad?  Thomas Markle Sr., 73, used to work as a TV lighting director and cinematographer and has since retired to Mexico. Much has been made of Meghan’s relationship with her dad, as he and her mom divorced when Meghan was 6. Thomas has never met Harry, but they’ve reportedly spoken by phone. An “insider” recently told People magazine, “Like any father-daughter relationship, there have been ups and downs over the years. But they are in a good place now.”  Then it gets confusing. In early May, Meghan’s half-brother (more about him later) sent a nasty letter to Harry, imploring him not to marry Meghan and calling it “the biggest mistake in wedding history.” The letter, obtained by In Touch magazine, claimed Meghan’s father had not received an invitation to the wedding. However, the palace released a statement at the time confirming that Thomas would walk his daughter down the aisle. So that was weird.  However, things fell apart this week when it was revealed that Thomas Sr. had been working with the paparazzi to stage photos of himself: Reading a book on Great Britain, getting fitted for a suit, etc. This did not go over well, as the palace had chastised the media for badgering him. On Monday, Thomas told TMZ that he regretted the photos, saying they were “stupid and hammy,” and said he would not be attending the wedding because of a recent heart attack. A day later, he changed his mind and said he would love to go. Then, he contacted TMZ once more to say that he had to undergo heart surgery on Wednesday, and he would officially not be attending.  Early in the week, the palace sidestepped commenting on this mess, as a spokesperson simply said, “This is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation.”  On Thursday, Markle finally weighed in: “Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.”  And what’s up with her half-sister?  Samantha Markle, 53, is Thomas Sr.’s daughter from his first marriage and lives in Florida with her three kids. She made headlines early in Meghan and Harry’s relationship when it was reported she was penning a tell-all memoir called “The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister.” (The two reportedly haven’t spoken in years.) Samantha also trashed her half-sister in interviews, calling her a “shallow social climber” only interested in fame. Later, she changed her tune, saying Meghan was “absolutely lovely.”  So guess who wasn’t invited to the wedding? Plus, Samantha admitted this week she was the one who persuaded their father to take those staged pictures, thinking it would help improve his image. This earned her a dressing-down from TV host Piers Morgan, who called her a “little vulture.”  Why did Meghan’s half-brother write such a cruel letter to Harry?  It’s unclear — maybe Thomas Jr., 50 (Thomas Sr.’s son from his first marriage) was upset that he was left off the wedding guest list? “Meghan Markle is obviously not the right woman for you,” he wrote to Harry, adding his half-sister was a “jaded, shallow, conceited woman that will make a joke of you and the royal family heritage.” Thomas Jr. later appeared to regret this, as he gave a follow-up letter to In Touch in which he begged Meghan for a wedding invitation, trying to guilt her with the line, “We are all still family.” We’re guessing that it did not work.  However, Thomas Jr.’s ex-wife, Tracy, and their sons, Tyler and Thomas, did not let that deter them — they recently landed in London, where they’ll be acting as wedding correspondents for “Good Morning Britain.”    Meghan Markle watches the closing ceremonies of the Invictus Games with her mother, Doria Ragland, in Toronto last year. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press/AP)  What about her mom?    Doria Ragland, 61, is a yoga instructor and social worker. Meghan is her only child, and they’re extremely close. Before the engagement, she met Harry, who proclaimed her “amazing.” Tabloids reported that Doria, who lives in Los Angeles, recently quit her job at a mental health clinic. (Hmmm, could she be moving out of the country sometime in the future?) It has been speculated that Doria could walk her daughter down the aisle. (Update: Prince Charles is actually going to do it.) Either way, she arrived in London earlier this week to spend time with Meghan and meet the royal family.  Is her ex-husband really producing a TV show based on their relationship?  Meghan married film producer Trevor Engelson in 2011; they split two years later. In September 2017, Deadline reported that Engelson was shopping a fictional TV comedy with the description: “Divorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London’s tabloid media, is next level.” Hmmm. The idea was apparently sparked when Engelson and another producer were talking about what could have happened if he and Meghan had kids.  However, the Sun recently reported that Engelson, after being persuaded by Meghan and some mutual friends, has put the project on hold — for now.  Is there any drama on Harry’s side of the family?  Have you seen “The Crown”? You have? Good. That’s probably all the intense Windsor drama you’re going to get. Because Harry and Meghan limited the size of their guest list — it still includes 600 people, so everyone can chill — some distant relatives who were invited to William’s wedding were not invited to Harry’s. The royals are trained in remaining tight-lipped about most drama, of course, so we don’t know whether these minor snubs have caused any problems.  What’s up with those rumors about Meghan and Kate feuding?  Meghan’s eloquence and openness have earned her comparisons to Harry’s late mother, Princess Diana, often called the “People’s Princess.” Several tabloids report Kate is jealous of this comparison and Meghan’s overall popularity with the family and public.  But some rumors are simply rumors, friends, as Meghan and Kate have shown no signs of fighting — in public, at least. They both attended a Royal Foundation event with their significant others in February, during which the foursome were asked whether they ever disagree.  William replied, “Ohhh, yes,” according to Vanity Fair. Harry elaborated: “I think it’s really good we have got four different personalities and we all have that same passion to make a difference. We have different opinions and they work really well [together].” He then noted that they are all “stuck together for the rest of our lives,” to which Meghan added, “Togetherness at its finest.”    Prince Harry, Meghan Markle and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, attend the first annual Royal Foundation Forum. (Chris Jackson/AFP/Getty Images)  What roles will William and Kate have in the wedding?  A few months after William said his younger brother had not yet asked him to be his best man — “It could be a sensitive subject,” he joked on a radio show — Kensington Palace announced that William would, in fact, return the favor that Harry did for him in 2011. Kate probably won’t have a formal role during the ceremony, according to a Vanity Fair source who said Meghan and Harry “just want Kate to be able to enjoy the day and not worry about anything.” William and Kate’s older children, George and Charlotte, will be in the wedding party, while young Louis will stay at home.  [Little royals George and Charlotte threaten to upstage everyone else at Uncle Harry’s wedding]  Are Harry’s exes invited to the wedding?  Probably! Harry is said to be on good terms with Cressida Bonas, whom he dated for two years, and Chelsy Davy, whom he dated on-and-off for seven. There’s also precedent: Several of William’s exes attended his wedding, and Prince Charles’s then-ex-girlfriend — now his wife, Duchess Camilla — attended his to Diana.  Which celebrities will be there?  Never forget that before she ascended to royalty, Meghan was a mere Hollywood celebrity. Several actors from “Suits,” the USA network legal drama that propelled her to fame, are expected to attend the ceremony: Gabriel Macht, Patrick J. Adams, Sarah Rafferty, Gina Torres and Rick Hoffman. All five Spice Girls — British royalty in their own right — likely will, too, along with Meghan’s pals Priyanka Chopra and Serena Williams. Despite their friendship with Harry, Barack and Michelle Obama will not be present.

            "text: Princess Eugenie of York and her now-husband Jack Brooksbank, the U.K. ambassador for George Clooney and Rande Gerber's tequila brand, Casamigos, were together for about seven years before tying the knot. But they kept much of their relationship out of the public eye. Here's what you need to know about newlyweds Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's love story.  They first met in Verbier, Switzerland.  Getty Images Tim Graham  The happy couple first met in 2010, at Verbier, a Swiss holiday resort and ski area, when Princess Eugenie was 20 and Brooksbank was 24, according to the BBC. Verbier is a popular holiday destination for the royals, and Eugenie had been vacationing there for years with her mother, the Duchess of York, and her sister, Princess Beatrice. Eugenie's parents, the divorced Duke and Duchess of York, eventually bought a chalet there in 2015.  Jack and Eugenie are actually distantly related.  It was recently revealed that they are distant cousins, much like Eugenie's grandmother Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip.  The duo attended their first Royal Ascot together in 2011.  Getty Images  In one of their first appearances as a couple, Brooksbank attended the annual horse race with Eugenie in 2011, soon after they began dating. However, Kate Middleton reportedly wasn't invited to Ascot until her 2011 marriage to Eugenie's cousin, Prince William. This is probably due to the fact that Eugenie is not a working royal—and thus has fewer rules to follow. This is also why Princess Eugenie is one of the only members of the British family to have an Instagram account.  They were long-distance while Eugenie lived in New York.  Getty Images  In 2013, Eugenie left London for New York, where she worked for online auction house Paddle8. Later that year, Brooksbank spoke to the Daily Mail in his first interview, explaining how the couple was handling the separation.\"We spend a lot of time on Skype,\" he said. \"It’s great. We are still very much together.\"  Eugenie moved back to London in 2015.  Getty Images  Eugenie moved back to London in 2015 and the couple began spending more time together. In 2016, Eugenie shared what their home life was like with Harper's Bazaar. \"When I'm with Jack, we watch The Walking Dead, which we're obsessed with,\" she said. \"Maybe Game of Thrones is our next thing. I don't watch reality shows, but I love cooking programs.\"  In that same interview, Eugenie shared that her boyfriend and dog have the same name, which she says was a \"total accident!\"  The next year, they marked a milestone in their relationship.  In September 2016, the couple joined the Queen and other members of the royal family for a weekend stay at Balmoral, the Queen's Scottish retreat, fueling engagement rumors. Eugenie's cousin, Prince Harry, hosted a shooting party at the castle to celebrate his 32nd birthday, with an insider telling The Daily Express, \"You could call this weekend a rite of passage for Jack. There is no way he would be invited to stay with the Queen unless he was being welcomed into the royal fold and the bosom of the family.\"  They attended Pippa Middleton's wedding together.  Getty Images  In May 2017, Eugenie and Brooksbank attended the nuptials of Pippa Middleton and James Matthews. Eugenie wore a stunning Paule Ka dress, while Brooksbank opted for a traditional coat with tails.  Brooksbank proposed to Eugenie in Nicaragua in January 2018.  In a video posted on The Royal Family's YouTube account, Brooksbank described the setting on the day he got down on one knee as having a \"beautiful volcano, summer setting, birds are flying.\"  Eugenie also spoke about the surprise engagement. \"The lake was so beautiful. The light was just a special light I had never seen,\" she said. \"I actually said this is an incredible moment, and then he popped the question, which was really surprising even though we have been together seven years. I was over the moon.\"  The royal family responded to the engagement with well wishes.  The wedding will take place in the Autumn of 2018 at St George's Chapel in Windsor, with further details to be announced in due course. pic.twitter.com/3oL6F6hoYG — The Royal Family (@RoyalFamily) January 22, 2018  On January 22, 2018, the offficial Royal Family Twitter account announced the engagement, saying, \"The Duke And Duchess of York are delighted to announce the engagement of Princess Eugenie to Jack Brooksbank.\"  Eugenie's mother also chimed in on Twitter with her well wishes, stating simply \"Total joy!!\"  Their engagement photoshoot followed right after the engagement announcement.  Getty Images  The couple posed for a series of portraits taken at Buckingham Palace shortly after they announced their engagement, where the Princess showed off her engagement ring. The ring features a padparadscha sapphire and is surrounded by diamonds, and looks very similar to the ring that her father, Prince Andrew, used to propose to her mother.  In an interview about their upcoming nuptials, Brooksbank said the Queen, \"wished us well, which was amazing, it was very nice that she was so happy for us.\"  They made their first official royal appearance together on Easter Sunday.  Getty Images  Three months after announcing their engagement, the couple headed to the Easter Sunday church service held at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, which is also their wedding venue. It was their first official appearance at a royal event together.  They also attended Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's wedding.  Getty Images  Just a month later, in May 2018, Eugenie and Brooksbank headed to another event at St. George's Chapel. This time it was the wedding of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry. Eugenie sported a light blue dress topped with a pillbox hat, while Brooksbank opted for dark suit with a light blue tie to match his fianceé. Eugenie and Brooksbank now live right next door to the newly minted Duke and Duchess.  They started the summer at the Serpentine Summer Party.  Getty Images  With just four months to go until the big day, the couple attended the Serpentine Summer Party, an annual soireé that's hosted by Chanel. Eugenie looked radiant in a patterned one shoulder tunic over black leggings, and Brooksbank wore a navy suit with a yellow tie.  And even showed a little PDA at the wedding of Charlie van Straubenzee and Daisy Jenks.  Getty Images Joe Giddens - PA Images  Aww! Eugenie's cousin Harry and his new bride Meghan were also in attendance at the nuptials in Surrey.  They got married at St.George's Chapel on October 12, 2018.

            "text: Meghan Markle‘s foretelling snap of her 15-year-old self posing outside Buckingham Palace has become a perfect photo opportunity — just ask Olivia Munn!  The 38-year-old actress recently channeled Meghan and childhood friend Ninaki Priddy, who snapped what they thought was just a regular tourist picture during a summer of 1996 trip to London. Little did they know that two decades later, Meghan would be married to Prince Harry and a full-fledged member of the royal family!  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Munn recreated the piece of royal history alongside pal Matthew Hoffman, who shared the imitation picture on Instagram and included their inspiration in his post. Hoffman took Meghan’s spot with Munn sitting to his left, perched on the top of the barricade with their feet on the lower rail, just like Meghan and her pal.  “🇬🇧 Tourists,” Hoffman captioned the set of pictures, which also included snaps on top of a double decker bus and some vacation selfies.  Matthew Hoffman and Olivia Munn Matthew Hoffman/Instagram  Of course, Meghan doesn’t have to stay behind the palace gates any longer. After meeting Prince Harry on a blind date in July 2016, she quickly won the royal’s heart and the two wed at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle in May 2018.  The 36-year-old American made her official debut on the iconic balcony of Buckingham Palace in June during the Trooping the Colour celebrations to mark the Queen’s official birthday.  Meghan Markle and Prince Harry James Whatling/MEGA  Royal Family at Trooping the Colour Chris Jackson/Getty Images  After a horse-drawn carriage ride with Harry to Buckingham Palace, Meghan gathered on the balcony with the rest of the royals to take in the iconic fly-past by the Royal Air Force. Meghan’s first appearance on the balcony, which came just weeks after she wed Prince Harry, was symbolic of how she has been welcomed into the family.

During the event, they observed a thunderous fly-over by 100 aircrafts, including jet fighters, World War II Lancaster bombers and the ceremonial Red Arrows. There was also a Feu de Joie, or mass rifle salute, to complete the military pageantry.\n",

            "text: Meghan Markle‘s style has evolved dramatically since becoming a duchess — she wears midlength dresses and pantyhose, and even rocks a fascinator — but she’s made a surprise return to her roots.  On Sunday, Meghan supported Prince Harry at the Audi Polo Challenge at Ascot’s Coworth Park Polo Club (on what would have been Diana, Princess of Wales’s 57th birthday), looking relaxed in a white button-down shirt from J.Crew, black cropped Everlane pants with matching Chanel flats, and a $58 Panama hat (reportedly by Madewell x Biltmore).  ICYMI - Meghan Attends Another Day of Polo https://t.co/qh2f6Vki2h — Meghans Mirror (@MeghansMirror) July 2, 2018  The 36-year-old also brought her cross-body bag back to life, an accessory she retired in favor of dainty clutches, which royals typically carry to avoid shaking hands with the public.  Royal watchers loved seeing Meghan going back to her casual roots.  I love seeing her casual, laid back vibe again! — Teri Wilson (@TeriWilsonauthr) July 1, 2018  Meghan looks lovely and more importantly happy. 👌 — Erikk_the_Dane™ (@Erikk_the_Dane2) July 1, 2018  Although the royal dress code is specific and polo matches are significant events for the monarchy, grassy fields aren’t forgiving of stilettos, and Meghan was probably mimicking sister-in-law Kate Middleton, who regularly swaps tailored dresses for summery (and affordable) sundresses, jeans, and flats.  11 PHOTOS Meghan Markle at the Young Leaders program See Gallery Meghan Markle at the Young Leaders program The Duke and Duchess of Sussex at the Queen's Young Leaders Awards Ceremony at Buckingham Palace, London.

Social media compared Meghan to Julia Roberts‘s character in Pretty Woman and according to the Daily Mail, the entire ensemble was sold out in two days.  Prior to royal life, the duchess embodied a breezy style — even for her first public appearance with Harry, she wore torn blue jeans from Mother (which the brand reissued due to the “insanely high demand“) and a white button-down shirt from Misha Nonoo.  However, since her wedding, she’s been side-eyed by some fashionistas. Social media dismissed her two wedding dresses by Givenchy and Stella McCartney as “baggy.” And they called the blue-and-white Oscar de la Renta dress she wore to the June wedding of Harry’s cousin Celia McCorquodale “frumpy.”  According to the New York Post, Meghan is still honing her wardrobe. “Over the next year, Meghan will have more designers throwing themselves at her, and she will adapt her style,” British designer Caroline Castigliano told the publication. “It will be fabulous when she takes everything she learns and ‘Meghan-izes’ it.”  102 PHOTOS Meghan Markle's style transformation See Gallery Meghan Markle's style transformation Meghan Markle attends COACH Legacy Photo Exhibit by REED KRAKOFF at Coach on August 26, 2006 in East Hampton, NY.

With engagements and weddings, two pregnancies and a birth, the family has grown and found news reasons to celebrate even as the usual packed schedule of events and foreign trips continues.  For people constantly in the public eye, the royals are unsurprisingly great at shaking the right hands, smiling at the right moments, and generally keeping it all together to make sure they get things done.

The 73-year-old announced Tuesday that he was going to try and walk his daughter down the aisle, despite his staged photo controversy — but was then forced to walk the statement back after learning from doctors that he needed heart surgery.  “They will go in and clear blockage, repair damage and put a stent where it is needed,” Thomas Markle told TMZ.  The former television lighting director has been recovering from a heart attack he suffered last week, which left him with a “seriously damaged” heart. Thomas was reportedly back in the hospital on Tuesday undergoing a series of tests.  He had come forward on Monday and said he wasn’t going to be a part of Markle and Prince Harry’s nuptials because he didn’t want to embarrass her following the paparazzi photo controversy. But Thomas reportedly slept on it and changed his mind Tuesday morning.  “Of course I’d walk her down the aisle,” he told TMZ. “This is a historic moment.”  While Thomas initially thought the surgery wouldn’t complicate things, he said he now realizes how hard it would be to make the trip across the Pond.  In response to her father not making it, a spokesman for Kensington Palace released a statement late Monday saying: “This is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation.”  Thomas told TMZ that his daughter called him on Monday, but he missed the call. She reportedly texted him and said she loved him, was concerned about his health, and didn’t blame him for the staged photos.  The Daily Mail revealed Sunday that Thomas secretly collaborated with a paparazzi agency to set up the pics, which showed him reading stories about his daughter’s wedding and getting fitted for a suit.  Sources told The Post that he was “set up” by the LA-based company, identified as the Coleman-Rayner News Picture Agency.  They apparently took pics of Thomas drinking and entering a fleabag hotel — and threatened to release them if he didn’t agree to pose for them.  “They told him if he posed, they wouldn’t put out the other pictures,” a source explained. “They told him they’d make him look good. They also gave him a few bucks for his trouble.”  Coleman-Rayner did not immediately return calls or emails seeking comment about the alleged setup.  While Queen Elizabeth II was reportedly “very angry” about the photo controversy, Thomas told TMZ he didn’t think she really cared at all.  “I don’t think the queen is thinking about what I’m doing,” he said.\n",

(Photo: ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP/Getty Images)  It's Christmas again, the time of year when British royals generally step up their round of good work and cheery public appearances before disappearing to private celebrations, far from prying eyes. This year is no different.  Routine is built into royal life, especially for senior royals such as Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles the Prince of Wales, whose busy schedules are usually laid out for them months or years in advance.  Each royal year has a certain rhythm: Easter at Windsor Castle, Trooping the Colour and Royal Ascot in June, the annual eight-week holiday at Balmoral in Scotland in late summer, Remembrance Day in November, and Christmas always at Sandringham House.  Sandringham:  For the past three decades, the queen has hosted her sprawling family at her private estate in Norfolk for the Christmas and New Year holidays. There they exchange cheap gag gifts and sit down to a black-tie Christmas dinner on Christmas Eve.  On Christmas morning, they have breakfast (the men go downstairs for a hearty \"fry up,\" the women have something light served in their rooms, according to former royal chef Darren McGrady), then gather before 11 a.m. local time to walk to services at nearby St. Mary Magdalene Church. They return for Christmas lunch and then gather around the TV to watch the queen's annual Christmas speech to the nation and the Commonwealth.  (This is required watching for the family as it is the only speech the queen gets to write herself without involvement from the government of the day. It used to be broadcast from Sandringham, starting with her grandfather in 1936, but now she usually records it ahead of time.)  A clutch of British royals, led by Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla Duchess of Cornwall, walk to attend a Christmas service in Sandringham, Dec. 25, 2016. (Photo: Kirsty Wigglesworth/ AP)  Why Christmas at Sandringham? It's a private country mansion, unlike Windsor Castle, some of which is open to the public. Unlike Windsor, it's about two hours away by train from London and the media, although there is always an organized photo shoot of the family walking to their little church, even Prince Philip, 97. But not the queen; she is usually driven to church.  Most important, Sandringham is much-loved by the queen and her family, including her father and grandfather, both of whom died there.  Last year, Prince Harry and his then-fiancee, Meghan Markle, were among the walkers –an unprecedented honor for her since she had not yet officially joined the family, their May wedding still months away.  Sandringham estate is sprawling (20,000 acres) so it's suitable for the annual Boxing Day (Dec. 26) pheasant shoot that Philip used to be in charge of organizing, although now that he's finally retired from public life, he may have passed that task on to someone else.  Last year, Harry skipped the shoot, reportedly to spare Meghan's animal-rights sympathies, and he may be absent again this year. Harry's mother, the late Princess Diana, also loathed blood sports but from boyhood on, her sons have joined in enthusiastically with their royal relations.

Prince William and Duchess Kate of Cambridge and their three children, Prince George, 5, Princess Charlotte, 3, and baby Prince Louis, have a country retreat, Anmer Hall, nearby on the estate, gifted to them by the queen.  Their retreat allows them to participate in the Christmas festivities at Sandringham House while also hanging out with their three small children.  Anmer Hall on the Sandringham Estate on Jan. 13, 2013. (Photo: Indigo/Getty Images)  Last year, Harry and Meghan stayed with Will and Kate at Anmer Hall for Christmas. This year, when they are expecting their first child in the spring, they are going to be at Sandringham alongside Will and Kate, despite all the tabloid rumor-mongering about alleged tensions between the brothers and their wives.  Sometimes Will and Harry play in a charity soccer match on Christmas Eve, pitting Sandringham staff and estate neighbors.  Will and Kate take Christmas cheer to military families:  The Cambridges went all the way to Cyprus to say Merry Christmas to Royal Air Force families. First, on Dec. 4, they hosted a holiday party at Kensington Palace for families whose loved ones are serving at a British base on the island.

(Photo: Richard Pohle/ AP)  They collected gifts and letters from the children and the next day hopped on a plane to deliver them to the men and women based at RAF Akrotiri, where they attended another Christmas party for troops who will be apart from their families throughout the holiday season.  Kensington Palace's Twitter account quickly filled up with tweets documenting the fun and laughs had by all at both parties.

In past years, Kate has also attended the annual Christmas party at one of her older patronages, the Anna Freud National Center for Children and Families, a child mental health research, training and treatment center in London.  Duchess Meghan's Christmas appearance  In keeping with her former career as an actress (USA's \"Suits\"), she made a solo visit to the Royal Variety Charity’s residential nursing and care home, Brinsworth House in London, on Tuesday to bring holiday cheer to three dozen residents, including singing carols around a Christmas tree.  Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan of Sussex watch fireworks at their wedding reception at Frogmore House, Windsor, on May 19, 2018. The picture is on their Christmas card for 2018. (Photo: Chris Allerton/ PA / Handout/ EPA-EFE)  The Royal Variety Charity, of which the queen is patron, may end up in Meghan's portfolio when the palace announces her royal philanthropic menu next year.  It's a good fit for her, as the charity helps take care of hundreds of retired entertainers who have fallen on hard times due to old age, illness or financial disaster.  The charity is supported in part by the annual Royal Variety Performance in November in London, which Meghan attended this year with Prince Harry.  Camilla's Christmas tradition:  Duchess Camilla of Cornwall, the second wife of Prince Charles, is a big fan of Christmas. Every year in early December she hosts a children's lunch party at Clarence House in London where the kids help her decorate the palace Christmas tree.  “The tree decorating for me is always the start of Christmas,\" she told reporters the day of the Dec. 6 party this year. \"I haven’t thought about it before today, but I come in and see the tree and the children and everything and it just gets me in a Christmas mood.\"  Duchess Camilla of Cornwall meets reindeer Dancer, left, and Blitzen, right, with their handlers Karen and Jason Perrins in the gardens at Clarence House in London, Dec. 6, 2018. (Photo: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP)  This year, she took some of the kids outside to meet two reindeer, \"Dancer\" and \"Blitzen,\" and their handler elves, leading to cute pictures of them all feeding lichen to the not-so-tiny antlered critters.  For the past nine years, the kids and families invited to Camilla's party have been beneficiaries of the Helen & Douglas House hospice center and Roald Dahl's Marvellous Children's Charity, two organizations for which Camilla serves as patron. Every year the organizations help support thousands of children who suffer from chronic illnesses.  The queen's Christmas lunch:  The week before Christmas, the queen hosts a huge festive lunch for her extended family at Buckingham Palace, including those who will not be at Sandringham. This gives the monarch an opportunity to catch up with relatives she might not see regularly during the year.  Last year, Meghan Markle was included, in another sign of how quickly she was accepted into the family ahead of the wedding. Tradition reportedly dictates that the lunch is attended by only relatives and spouses.  On Wednesday, Dec. 19, Meghan was photographed smiling next to Harry as the two drove onto the palace grounds for this year's luncheon. She sported large diamond studs and what appeared to be a top with a high collar.

Photographers also captured Prince George peeking through the backseat.  Prince William, Duchess Kate and their son Prince George arrive at the queen's Christmas lunch.

Their routine was interrupted (a rarity) in 2016 when, the day after the lunch, Buckingham Palace suddenly announced they had postponed their departure because the two had \"heavy colds.\" They were flown there by helicopter the next day.

(Photo: JOHN STILLWELL/AFP/Getty Images)  The Royal Christmas Cards:  Every year, Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla, Will and Kate, and now Harry and Meghan send out Christmas cards featuring family photos. This year, Charles and Camilla posed on a garden bench at Clarence House, their London home. The Cambridges posed in the branches of a tree in the garden at Anmer Hall.  And Harry and Meghan chose a previously unseen black and white photo of themselves watching the fireworks at Frogmore House after their second wedding reception to adorn their 2018 card.  But it's the card from the queen that counts. Every year, she and Prince Philip send around 750, usually featuring a family photo, to family, friends and members of the Royal Household staff, along with others such as British and Commonwealth prime ministers, governors-general and high commissioners.  Prince Philip usually sends another 200 cards to different regiments and organizations with whom he's long been associated.  The Royal Christmas Gifts:  All members of the Royal Household receive presents from the queen, who personally hands them out to some members of her household staff at Buckingham Palace and at Windsor Castle.  Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla pose on the grounds of Clarence House, London, for their 2018 Christmas card. (Photo: Hugo Burnand/Clarence House via AP)  The Royal Christmas Puddings:  Continuing the tradition from her father, King George VI, and her grandfather, George V, the queen also gives out about 1,500 Christmas puddings to her staff in the palaces, in the Court Post Office and the palace police. Each pudding is accompanied by a greeting card from the queen and Prince Philip.  Americans are familiar with \"pudding\" as a custard treat. A British Christmas pudding, also known as a \"plum pudding\" or a \"figgy pudding,\" is nothing like that. It's a medieval soft cake-like dessert made of dried fruits held together by egg, suet, treacle or molasses, and flavored with spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger.  The Royal Christmas Trees:  The tradition of decorating trees at Christmas was popularized by British royals, specifically Queen Victoria and her German-born husband Prince Albert, both of whom had grown up with the custom. Her German ancestors introduced the idea to the English and her German mother continued it. By the 1860s it was a thing, with hundreds of trees being sold in Covent Garden.  As well as donating money to several charities in Windsor each Christmas, the queen also gives Christmas trees to Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's Cathedral, St. Giles' Cathedral and the Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh. Churches and schools in the Sandringham area will also receive a tree from Her Majesty.  Decorated trees go up at the London palaces, and at Sandringham there's a large silver artificial tree in the dining room decorated by the grandchildren and great-grandchildren, according to former royal chef McGrady, who dished about the tradition in an interview with Good Housekeeping.

            "text: The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.  Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.\n",

But today, Kensington Palace announced that the happy couple won't be jetting out of town immediately following their big day. Rather, they are delaying their trip to get back to work.  Meghan and Harry will attend an engagement in the week following their wedding, and then they'll head off to an undisclosed location.    “The couple will be going on honeymoon, but not straightaway,” Kensington Palace spokesman Jason Knauf said, according to People “They will have their first engagement as a married couple in the week after the wedding.”  That schedule is in keeping with what Markle said earlier this year about wanting to \"hit the ground running,\" once she officially becomes a member of the royal family.  Their plan is also similar to when Prince William and Duchess Kate went on their honeymoon. According to royal commentator Victoria Arbiter, \"William and Kate left for their honeymoon in the Seychelles 10 days after their wedding.

It is the first time a royal fiancee has been invited to Christmas celebrations.  Prince Harry said his family has welcomed Meghan Markle this holiday season.

She really enjoyed it.

The bride arrived with her father Michael at around 11.15am in an open-top classic car. She’s wearing a bespoke Giles Deacon dress, designed to create the impression of being seamless.  “I was thrilled to work with Pippa on her wedding dress,” Deacon said. “The dress is constructed with a cap sleeve, high neckline and features a corseted bodice with draping to the front and a heart-shaped detail at the back.  “The bespoke silk cotton lace was hand appliqued to create an illusion of the dress having 'no seams'. The lace bodice is embroidered with pearl detailing over an organza and tulle underskirt, which has layer upon layer to enable a floor sweeping movement.  “It's a privilege to show the craftsmanship that my team produces in London and a real testament to Pippa's support of British fashion.”  33-year-old party planner Pippa accessorised her dress with a Stephen Jones veil, a Maidenhair Fern tiara and Manolo Blahnik ivory satin shoes.  Around 100 guests were expected and hundreds of royal fans have descended on the quiet village for the occasion, some travelling from the other side of the world especially.  Matthews was previously considered one of the most eligible bachelors in the world, and is reportedly worth £2 billion.  Comparisons have also been made between Pippa and her sister Kate’s husbands, some pointing out the ‘old money’ vs ‘new money’ distinction.  On social media, many people are fascinated with the proceedings.  Not everyone is convinced all the fuss is necessary though.  Royal or not, no doubt people will continue be interested in the marriage of the couple.

Except maybe for a second baby.  In an interview with In Style magazine, the 36-year-old new mom says a second child would possibly send her into retirement. But she’ll have to discuss it with husband Alexis Ohanian first.  “I don’t know if I want to play if I have another baby, but you’re right. I need to talk to Alexis. We need a plan,” Williams said.  She also said, “If I weren’t working, I’d already be pregnant.”  Williams appears as the cover story for the magazine’s first-ever “Badass Women” issue. She talks about her first year of motherhood, how she and Reddit co-founder Ohanian hooked up, attending the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and, of course, all things badass.  Which women does Williams place in the badass category? They would be Beyonce, Rihanna and Kate Middleton.  And her own No. 1 badass moment involves her 10-month-old daughter, Olympia. Williams was nine weeks pregnant with Olympia in January 2017 when she won the Australian Open by ousting older sister Venus Williams in straight sets. It was Serena’s 23rd singles grand slam title.  “I had a really tough first round and an even tougher second round. I thought, ‘I’m probably going to lose early. That’s OK. I have a good excuse for the first time.'”  She consulted with a doctor about withdrawing from the tournament, but she was cleared to play with a warning to be careful on hot days.  “I was literally nine weeks by the end of the tournament. I was almost done with my first trimester,” she said. “Every day that passed I thought, ‘This is a dream.’ It was like an animated Disney movie. And by the time the quarterfinals came, I was like, ‘I know I can beat this girl,’ and at the semifinals I thought, ‘I know I can win this match.’ I didn’t think I would win the final, so when I won, it was like, ‘OK, this is crazy.'”  Get more celebrity news and photos delivered to your inbox for free on weekdays.

Williams says tennis has been pushed to the background as she and Olympia have fallen into a daily routine.  “So I feed her, and then she snuggles with me, which is the best part of my day,” she said. “Then we play, and after that I sneak away to practice, usually around 8 a.m. The only rule I have at practice is to be done at 1 p.m., because as much as I love tennis, I need to be with her.”  Related Articles ‘Watch What Happens Live’ host Andy Cohen to become dad  Audrey Geisel, widow of Dr. Seuss, dead at 97  Barack Obama appears on Miranda’s latest ‘Hamilton’ song  Michelle Obama can wear whatever she wants now, and what she wants is sparkly thigh-high boots  Oprah Winfrey reminds Academy voters of ‘Black Panther’ and its Oscar-worthiness Williams also spoke about becoming fascinated by Silicon Valley because of Ohanian.  “I didn’t know his world at all, but I’ve always been tech-savvy,” she said. “I had a few investments before I met him, and I wanted to know more. So we started talking, just as friends. Just casually chatting. I was getting hot when he was talking about it all. So after that we just continued talking, and then, I don’t know — I love his world.”\n",

            "text: This marks the royal’s first official public appearance on his own since the wedding. We have learned that Prince Harry headed for a ‘private visit’ to Pitseng, Lesotho in South Africa without his new bride Meghan Markle.  Apparently, Harry is set to be in attendance at the opening of a brand new dining hall at the Phelisanong Children’s Centres on behalf of the charity he co-founded with close pal Prince Seeiso back in 2006.  One spokesperson for the charity Sentebale (‘forget me not’) released the following statement: ‘The Duke was on a private visit to view the work of Sentebale at a camp for helpless children and youngsters, as well as other projects funded by the same charity. During this private working visit to Sentebale, the Duke visited one of its community-led partners for the opening of a brand new dining hall. This was funded by the charity and is set to provide a space for kids to eat together and have indoor space to play.’  Meanwhile, on the charity’s official webpage it can be read that ‘Sentebale supports the mental health as well as the well-being of kids and young people affected by HIV in Lesotho and Botswana. Our programs of education and care provide the tools and knowledge that this vulnerable generation needs to live long, happy, healthy lives in the future.’  According to Kensington Palace, Harry will also be part of a board meeting of a conservation charity named Africa Parks, that he is an advocate for.  However, it turns out that his little trip is set to end pretty soon as he also has to be there for Queen’s Young Leaders at Buckingham Palace reception on Tuesday.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Looking back at things Meghan Markle has said and done in her life so far, it seems that she was always destined for royalty.  She's always showed thoughtfulness, grace and intelligence - from campaigning against a sexist ad when she was just 11 years old to the humanitarian work she's been passionate about long before she married Prince Harry.  There's so much talk about the Duchess of Sussex every day, but what has she actually said about herself?  As she celebrates her 37th birthday this weekend, here's what Meghan has said on some of the most important things in her life - in her own words.  On happiness and self-acceptance  On her 33rd birthday Meghan wrote on her website The Tig about the ways she struggled with the idea of fitting in - before she realised it's important to be kind and accept yourself as you are.  \"I am 33 years old today. And I am happy. And I say that so plainly because, well…it takes time. To be happy. To figure out how to be kind to yourself. To not just choose that happiness, but to feel it.  \"My 20s were brutal – a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as cool/as hip/as smart/as \"whatever\" as everyone else. My teens were even worse – grappling with how to fit in, and what that even meant.  (Image: Getty Images Europe)  \" You need to know that you’re enough [is a] mantra that has now engrained itself so deeply within me that not a day goes by without hearing it chime in my head.  \"So for my birthday, here’s what I would like as a gift: I want you to be kind to yourself.\"  On her relationship with Harry  In an interview with Vanity Fair in 2016, Meghan spoke about her blossoming relationship with Prince Harry.  She said: \"We’re a couple... We’re in love.  \"I’m sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time. This is for us. It’s part of what makes it so special, that it’s just ours. But we’re happy. Personally, I love a great love story.\"  On the proposal  (Image: Getty)  In Meghan and Harry's first interview post-engagement, she told the BBC about how the proposal happened.  \"Just a cosy night. What were we doing? We were trying to roast a chicken. It was just an amazing surprise. It was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got down on one knee. . . As a matter of fact, I could barely let [him] finish proposing, like, 'Can I say yes now?!'\"  On feminism  In her speech at the UN in 2015, Meghan told the story of her 11-year-old self who was angry at a sexist TV ad - and how she felt compelled to do something about it:  \"I had been in school watching a TV show in elementary school and this commercial came on with the tag line for this dish washing liquid and the tag line said, ‘Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans’.  \"Two boys from my class said, ‘Yeah, that’s where women belong, in the kitchen’.  \"I remember feeling shocked and angry and also just feeling so hurt; it just wasn't right, and something needed to be done. So I went home and told my dad what had happened, and he encouraged me to write letters, so I did, to the most powerful people I could think of.\"  \"It is said that girls with dreams become women with vision. May we empower each other to carry out such vision — because it isn't enough to simply talk about equality. One must believe it. And it isn't enough to simply believe in it. One must work at it. Let us work at it. Together.\"  On her humanitarian work  (Image: PA)  In 2016, Meghan wrote on The Tig about how she feels she can't not do humanitarian work - particularly with the responsibility of someone in the entertainment industry who is looked up to.  \"I’ve never wanted to be a lady who lunches – I’ve always wanted to be a woman who works. And this type of work is what feeds my soul, and fuels my purpose.\"  On the Queen  (Image: Getty Images Europe)  In the royal couple's engagement interview on the BBC in November 2017, Meghan spoke about how she has the utmost respect for Harry's grandmother.  \"To be able to meet her through his lens, not just with his honor and respect for her as the monarch, but the love that he has for her as his grandmother… all of those layers have been so important for me so that when I met her, I had such a deep understanding and of course incredible respect for being able to have that time with her … She's an incredible woman.\"\n",

            "text: On November 27th last year, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced their engagement to the world.  Many were quite shocked as the Suits actress showed off her sparkling ring with diamonds that were once owned by his late mother, Princess Diana, as they had only been dating for 18 months.  Prince Harry told the BBC in their official engagement interview, \"She didn’t even let me finish (proposing). She said, ‘Can I say yes? Can I say yes?’ And then was hugs and I had the ring on my finger and I was like, can I give you the ring? She goes, ‘Oh yes, the ring.’ So no it was a really nice moment, it was just the two of us and I think managed to catch her by surprise as well.\" If the couple are to marry, then she will become the first American in 81 years to marry into the Royal family since Wallis Simpson married King Edward VIII, forcing his abdication from the throne.  Although the couple appeared to be happy, as time has gone by there have been a few scandals and complications. These are all the reasons why this romance is becoming less of a fairytale and more like it's heading for the rocks.  advertising  15 Why Did Harry Really Push Meghan's Hand Away In This Video?  express.co.uk  When you're one of the most photographed couples in the world, the paparazzi will be sure to capture moments you don't quite want to be made public.  Like in this video when Harry and Meghan were in Brixton for charity work, she reaches out for her hand but he shuns her away with no explanation.  Was there a fight in the car before they arrived? Or has the couple just been spending too much time together carrying out their Royal duties?  Locals weren't overjoyed by the visit as one accused their charity work of being a 'stunt'. Local storeowner Mike Eweje told the Daily Express, \"It’s a stunt for the Royal family. People don’t care about the Royal wedding because they don’t care about people around here.\"  14 Has Meghan Been Dishonest About The Royals Since The Very Beginning?  mix967.ca  advertising  According to Meghan, she didn't know anything about the Royal family before she met her Prince but a high school friend has revealed that's not true. Ninaki Priddy, who has known the former actress since she was 11, told the Daily Mail, \"I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating.\"  \"She had one of Princess Diana’s books (Diana: Her True Story) on her bookshelf, and even when she was with (her ex-husband) she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.\"  The ex-BFF also added that fame had completely changed Meghan, she said, \"Maybe she had started to change before then, but I was refusing to see it. The tone of her voice, her mannerisms, the way she laughed didn’t seem real to me anymore.\"  13 Marriage Of Royalty And Hollywood Is Too Risky For House Windsor  businessinsider.com  For many commentators, the marriage of Hollywood and Royalty simply doesn't work and could even be the end of House Windsor.  One anonymous staffer who works inside the palace told the Daily Star, \"I know Her Majesty and the Prince of Wales are not happy with her. It is very serious.\"  The monarchy is already fragile as the public has less patience with the Royal ways, so could this marriage be the final nail in the coffin?  Max Hastings from the Daily Mail revealed, \"Now that Ms. Markle has gushed all over Vanity Fair about her relationship with Harry for no better purpose than to satisfy a yearning for fame, she cannot at some future date reinvent herself as a princess. The monarchy is sustained by a web of delightful illusions and fantasies that are based on the concealment from the eyes of us commoners, the humdrum ordinariness of the Royal Family’s individual members.\"  12 Harry Is The Ultimate Commitment-Phobe  vanityfair.com  advertising  It's fair to say that Prince Harry isn't the type of guy who likes commitment. He is well known for his on-and-off relationship with Chelsea Davey that lasted for a bumpy seven years and she was even his date at his brother's wedding. He also dated TV presenter Natalie Pinkham, he enjoyed drink dates with Kate's good friend Astrid Harbord and he was hooking up with presenter Caroline Flack as well.  Flack recalls, \"Once the story got out, that was it. We had to stop seeing each other. I was no longer Caroline Flack, TV presenter, I was Caroline Flack, Prince Harry's bit of rough.\"  It's been tough for any woman to try and get him to commit for good and there is always the chance he will get cold feet before the big day. One source told The Daily Beast, \"There is always room for doubt because he is a serial commitment-phobe. He is said to be a ‘love addict’ and his parents’ example is far from encouraging.\"  11 Meghan Forced To Erase Her Whole Social Media History  usanetwork.com  Meghan, just like the rest of us, loved her social media and would regularly update her accounts with pictures of her on a holiday or relaxing at home. However, there is no place for Instagram or Twitter in the Royal family, so those accounts had to go for good.  She also had to shut down her own lifestyle blog, The Tig, after she started dating Harry.  The official statement from the palace said she was \"grateful to everyone who has followed her social media accounts over the years\" but had closed them \"as she has not used these accounts for some time.\" Meghan will likely be devastated that she no longer has social media, as she loves the attention. Her former BFF revealed, \"She just loved to be the center of attention. We used to imagine her receiving an Oscar. She used to practice announcing herself.\"  10 They Have Only Known Each Other For 18 months  abcnews.go.com  advertising  When Harry popped the question he had only known Meghan for 18 months, but he was clearly in a rush to get her down the aisle.  Things didn't go so well in the beginning as Harry issued a statement to the press asking for the \"abuse and harassment\" of his girlfriend to end.  Then on November 27th last year, Clarence House and Kensington Palace both announced that Harry and Meghan were engaged, but was it all happening too fast?  The couple hasn't spent that much time together as they have both been busy, Harry in the UK and Meghan in the USA. According to many studies, those who waited for three years before getting married had decreased the likelihood of divorce by 50%. Rushing into things might spell doom for the couple before they even know it.  9 Meghan's Half-Sister's Book Could Destroy Everything  usmagazine.com  One thing the Royal family won't be looking forward to is the release of Meghan's half-sister's tell-all book. Samantha Grant who lives in Florida claims she raised Meghan herself as the two were growing up.  She also revealed that her half-sister is a \"social climber\" and has always had a \"soft spot for gingers\".  The current working title for the book is 'The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister' so it's pretty clear what kind of book this going to be.  She also revealed that their father is bankrupt, but Meghan hasn't reached out to help. When Meghan wore a $75,000 designer dress for her engagement photo, her sister said, \"If you can spend $75,000 on a dress, you can spend $75,000 on your dad.\" He filed for bankruptcy last year with just $200 to his name.  advertising  8 Meghan Won't Be Able To Cope With The Terrifying Publicity  via: Pinterest.com  advertising  20 years ago, Harry's late mother Princess Diana was chased by the paparazzi and crashed in a Paris tunnel, which resulted in her death. The cameras were still flashing even as they struggled to pull her body from the wreck. Now, you would think the media learned from the incident and they would be less intrusive, but it appears they have just become worse.  Last year, she was the most searched woman on Google and her name dominates the headlines almost every day.  Top bodyguard Garry Curtis who once looked after the Beckham family told the Mirror online, \"I can only imagine that at the start she will find it extremely claustrophobic. Any family that has financial wealth around them is going to be a potential target of intimidation, possible kidnap, these days computer theft and hacking and people looking for family photos for blackmail.\" Sounds terrifying to us.  7 Meghan's Ex-Husband Is Making A Comedy About Their Divorce  radaronline.com  Another person who was once close to Meghan and also wants to sell her out is the ex-husband, Trevor Engelson, who was married to the Suits star from 2011 to 2013.  Now it's been revealed that he plans to make a tell-all comedy about their divorce and the pilot has been ordered by Fox network.  The show is about a divorced dad who has to work with his ex-wife to share custody of their kids, according to Deadline. The situation is complicated as the woman moves on from the split by marrying a British prince and although they never had children together, it's going to be quite obviously about Meghan and Harry.  So far, Modern Family's executive producer Danny Zuker has joined the project as producer and writer. It's yet another embarrassing blow for the Royals who will already see Meghan's divorce as a setback.  6 The Queen Will Refuse To Attend The Big Day  vanityfair.com  advertising  It's very likely that the Queen will snub the Royal wedding even though she would be a crucial and celebrated guest. According to speculation, the Queen won't witness the nuptials first-hand because Meghan has been married before. In 2005, her majesty didn't attend the wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla for the exact same reason - choosing to skip her son's big day.  A senior Royal official told the Daily Express, \"The Queen takes her position as Supreme Governor of the Church of England incredibly seriously. She also has great personal faith.\"  Her former best friend told the Daily Mail that Meghan's husband did not see the divorce coming, she revealed, \"I think everybody who knew them both was in shock. All I can say now is that I think Meghan was calculated, very calculated, in the way she handled people and relationships.\"  5 She Has Already Failed A Mock British Citizenship Test  mirror.co.uk  Maybe British history isn't Meghan's strong point, but if she wants to make a permanent move to the UK then she'll have to brush up for the citizenship test.  She sat down with comedy channel Dave who quizzed her on all things British but she failed to name local ales or where places were.  It's believed that she will leave her Toronto apartment behind and relocate to London with Harry and her dogs at Kensington Palace. They will then become the next-door neighbors of Prince William and Kate.  She told the host, \"Because I'm from the States, you don't grow up with the same understanding of the Royal family. While I now understand very clearly there's a global interest there, I didn't know much about (Prince Harry).\"  4 Meghan Has Too Many Skeletons In Her Closet  via: YouTube.com  advertising  Meghan's family history comes with quite a dark past; her half-brother, Tom, has spent a few nights in a jail cell following boozy fights and he also pointed a gun at her sister-in-law's head. One source told The Sun, \"He’s a loose cannon. It puts Meghan’s family in a bad light again. The last time he said he would get help. Everyone hopes they both do so now.\"  Meghan's father also has his own demons as he is struggling with bankruptcy.  Meghan's half-sister said Harry would be \"appalled by what she's done\" and that Meghan was a \"narcissist\" and \"selfish\".  She told the Daily Mail, \"The Royal Family would be appalled by what she's done to her own family. The truth would kill her relationship with Prince Harry, he wouldn't want to date her anymore because it puts her in a bad public light.\" We're sure her pending tell-all book will go into much more detail...  3 The Big Day Is Too Much Of A Clash With The Next Royal Baby  via: YouTube.com  The big day might have to be put on hold, as it's too much of a clash with the next Royal baby. William and Kate are expecting their third child, who will be fifth in line to the throne. The newborn is expected early April, however, if things become overdue it will clash with the Royal wedding.  William is expected to be the best man on the big day, so this could put the brakes on the occasion.  The website Mumsnet was flooded with complaints by angry parents about the clash in dates. One wrote, \"It'll be a dilemma for William as he'll want to celebrate the day, as will Catherine. If she's heavily pregnant or postpartum, he can't really get overly drunk.\" If things are going to get complicated, the couple might be better off calling the whole thing off.  2 Meghan Is Still Breaking Protocol By Talking To The Press  via: YouTube.com  advertising  After Harry and Meghan first announced their engagement, they both made a public outing in London to greet the crowds of well-wishers. Harry, walking ahead of Meghan, was shaking hands with the public and taking gifts, but when ITV’s Alison Hammond tried to talk to him, he quickly swerved her microphone. Something Harry isn't keen to do is talk to the press. However, the same couldn't be said for Meghan who walked right up to the reporter for a chat.  Meghan's Vanity Fair interview, where she discussed in detail about her relationship with the Prince, would have ruffled a few feathers at the palace.  She landed the cover and the title screamed, \"She just mad about Harry!\" It's this kind of 'vulgar Hollywood' publicity the Royals have tried to keep away from for many decades.  1 Even Psychics Say It's Doomed  AOL.com  Unfortunately for this couple, it's written in the stars that it just wasn't meant to be. Psychic Kerrie Erwin appeared on Australian morning show Sunrise and claimed the couple would 'struggle' with marriage. She revealed, \"I do get (feelings of) a pregnancy for her next year.\"  \"But actually, I don't think it's going to last. I'd probably give it five years. I feel there is a lot of personal things going on between them because they're two very strong individuals.\"  She added, \"Which is a sad thing. I wish them all the best. But it doesn't look good.\" The pair hasn't spent that much time together since they first started dating 18 months ago, so even they must not truly know how things will go. We'll just have to wait and see, but if the history of the Royal family is anything to by, this could be another rocky relationship.

            "text: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will officially be tying the knot at St. George's Chapel in...  Deal or No Deal  ...and each and every week, ET will be breaking down all the latest updates as they gear up for their May 19 nuptials.  BIGGEST NEWS OF THE WEEK  While there was plenty of royal news that flooded our inboxes this week, we were most excited about getting an update on Meghan's wedding dress! We already knew that she had selected a dress designer (thanks to her stylist-turned-pal, Jessica Mulroney), but now we know what she'll be wearing on her special day is officially in the design process!  A source told ET earlier this week that Meghan has already met with the dress designer, and is busy adding unique touches to the couple's big day.  We also found out that the Los Angeles native has been appointed a secretary to handle her increasingly busy royal schedule and duties. Amy Pickerill, a former Kensington Palace press officer, was announced on Monday as the new assistant private secretary in the office of Prince Harry.  As for Meghan and Prince Harry's actual wedding day, expect a lot of security. Ken Wharfe, the late Princess Diana's former bodyguard, told ET on Thursday that police will make sure nothing is overlooked for the massive occasion, and no expense will be spared.  \"From my own experiences -- and speaking to colleagues within the last few weeks -- Scotland Yard and neighboring police forces that will be part of this operation will be only too aware of how important it is to make sure that no stone is left unturned, and you know, one talks in this day of austerity of finance,\" he said. \"Trust me on this occasion, finance has nothing to do with this. Scotland Yard, together with Thames Valley Police -- which will be policing this event -- money is not an object, and they make sure that the very best of security is put on display to make sure that security is not compromised.\"  And after the soon-to-be-married couple's anthrax scare last Monday, we wouldn't be surprised if there's even more heightened security as they continue their royal duties ahead of their nuptials.  ROYAL RUMOR ROUNDUP  Looks like Megan and Kate Middleton have been spending even more quality time together! The former Suits star often goes from her Nottingham Cottage to Kate's humble abode to have tea or exchange advice, according to US Weekly.  “[Meghan] shares tips she’s read about healthy eating,\" a source told the publication.  And while it's not a rumor, it seems as if people are comparing Meghan to Princess Diana more and more frequently. According to multiple reports, the bride-to-be has been making secret visits to comfort victims of the Grenfell Tower, much like when Diana would also sneak away from Kensington Palace to visit hospital patients.  \"Meghan's visits mean so much to us. She has a special place in our hearts,\" one community member, who met the soon-to-be-royal, told E!  OUT AND ABOUT  After making a trip to Scotland, Meghan and Harry took a break from the spotlight this week -- but did have time for a fun date night.  The engaged couple attended a Hamilton show at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London's West End last Friday night. One of the show's cast members, Leslie Garcia Bowman, even took to Twitter to express his excitement over having the couple in attendance.  Was an honour to have Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in to watch @HamiltonWestEnd last night! — Leslie Garcia Bowman (@lesliegbowman) February 17, 2018  SERVIN' UP SUITS  If you've been following along with our royals countdown each week, then you're well aware that we've been binge-watching Meghan's show, Suits, since the beginning. This week, we were super happy to see Meghan, who plays aspiring lawyer Rachel Zane, try on an Anne Barge wedding gown during the \"Cold Feet\" episode of season 5.  When the episode originally aired on the USA network last year, Meghan spoke with Glamour, revealing some of her personal favorite bridal styles.  \"Delphine Manivet and Christos Costarellos are faves of mine for their uniqueness and beauty,\" she gushed at the time. \"I will always be a fan of Ellie Saab. J. Mendel is spectacular as well, especially for more structural designs.\"  Watch Meghan model her character's wedding dress in the video below:  SPARKLE LIKE MARKLE  Because our muscles are still kinda hating us from trying Meghan's favorite Pilates class last week (more on that HERE), we decided to take it easy this time by having a \"treat yourself\" night. We sat back, relaxed and drank like Meghan. Yes, turns out, girl loves a good wine!  \"God, do I love wine; a beautiful full red or a crisp white,\" she revealed in an interview with The New Potato in 2013. \"But if it’s cocktails, I love a spicy tequila cocktail, negroni, or good scotch (neat).\"  Shane Mahood/USA Network/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images  RATHER REGAL LOOKS  The queen-to-be truly shined! The seven-month pregnant Duchess of Cambridge looked exquisite at the 2018 BAFTAs, Britain's equivalent to the Oscars, on Feb. 18.  The expecting mother donned a dark green Jenny Packham gown with cap-sleeves and a black ribbon to accentuate her baby bump. Kate accessorized her regal look with emerald and diamond earrings and a matching necklace.  WPA Pool/Chris Jackson/Getty Images  NEXT IN LINE  Onto Prince William and, of course, more Kate!  The Duchess began her week alongside Sophie Countess of Wessex, by hosting the Commonwealth Fashion Exchange reception at Buckingham Palace. The brunette beauty arrived wearing a black-and-white floral print Erdem lace dress with black heels, and talked to designers and artisans from around the Commonwealth about their work.  Dominic Lipinski - Pool/Getty Images  Meanwhile, the Duke of Cambridge proved he's the coolest dad around town, taking a spin on a motorcycle during his trip to Triumph Motorcycles and MIRA Technology Park in Warwickshire on Feb. 20.

There, they put on hard hats and reflective vests as they ventured to the Northern Spire, a new bridge over the River Wear that is scheduled to open later this year.  Chris Jackson/Getty Images  Queen Elizabeth II also had quite the interesting week! Her Majesty graced fashionistas with her presence at London Fashion Week, where she presented the inaugural Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design to Richard Quinn. The 91-year-old head of the monarchy looked enthusiastic as she sat front row next to Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour at the emerging British designer's runway show.  Queen Elizabeth was sophisticatedly dressed in a powder blue Angela Kelly skirt and matching jacket with black gloves and a chic handbag.  Yui Mok - Pool/Getty Images  Lastly, what we've all been waiting for will finally happen. The Fab Four -- Kate, William, Meghan and Harry -- will all attend the first annual Royal Foundation Forum on Wednesday. And you can bet we'll be going all out for the royal couple's first engagement together since Christmas!  And that's a wrap on your weekly royals update.

            "text: Cressida Bonas is doing just fine, thank you very much.  Since dating Prince Harry from 2012-2014, the actress has become best known as a royal's girlfriend. But (not unlike Harry's wife, Meghan Markle) Bonas also has an acting career. And while some royal fans felt a pang of empathy watching Bonas attend her former boyfriend's wedding to Meghan, they don't have to—Bonas has some good things going, too.  Cressida Bonas arrives at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding. Getty Images IAN WEST  She's reportedly just been cast in the leading role for ITV's The White House Farm Murders, a six-part series is based on a notorious 1985 quintuple murder at an Essex family home. Decades later, the tragic event receives regular press, as the accused murderer Jeremy Bamber continues to challenge his conviction from prison.  Bonas will play the family's ill-fated daughter. Two other familiar faces will star alongside her: Alfie Allen and Mark Addy, who portrayed Theon Greyjoy and King Robert Baratheon, respectively, in Game of Thrones.

Getty Images Max Mumby/Indigo  Though the actress may never live down her association with Prince Harry, Bonas certainly seems to have moved on. She seemed perfectly at ease attending Harry and Meghan's wedding, and even blogged about the experience. \"Last weekend I attended the royal wedding,\" she wrote in a diary entry for the Spectator. \"The invitation clearly stated that guests must wear hats. Yikes. I opted for a minimal feathered number—and can only hope I got it right.\" Not even a mention of her former beau!  Bonas also made an appearance at the year's second royal wedding, between Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank. Eugenie and Cressida are longtime friends; it was actually Eugenie and her sister Beatrice who introduced Bonas to Prince Harry in the first place. So while she may not marry a Prince, Bonas still gets to run in royal circles—and that's really the best part anyways.\n",

            "text: From no selfie­s to perfec­ting the curtsy, the new Duches­s will be adjust­ing to a whole new lifest­yle  The Royal wedding created a lot of buzz worldwide and was followed by many chanting how ‘lucky’ Meghan Markle is to marry a prince. However, what most may not know is that it isn’t all fun and games. Becoming a royal comes with a lot of responsibility and rules.  Meghan too, will have to adhere to many of these royal rules to avoid major faux pas and stay in the Queen’s good books. Compiled from E! News, here are 17 rules the recently appointed Duchess of Sussex will have to follow.  1. No selfies  During her first official event with Prince Harry, Meghan revealed that she is no longer able to take selfies with fans. “We’re not allowed to do selfies,” she stated.  The rule was created to encourage people to make eye contact and make conversation with royals, rather than turning their backs to them to take a selfie.  2. No more autographs  The former Suits star most definitely has a pretty big fan following and has probably given out countless autographs in the past. However, under no circumstances is she allowed to sign any more autographs.  Prince Harry, Meghan Markle make first appearance after royal wedding  3. So long social media  Along with all her social media accounts, Meghan also had to give up her lifestyle blog The Tig. All social media for her is now handled by the royal family’s various accounts, but most updates about her and Harry are handled through the Kensington Palace account, as are the updates about Prince William and Kate Middleton.  Meghan’s not allowed to have her own social media page, which is why her own lifestyle blog and Instagram, The Tig, went dark last year.  4. No dark nails  Members of the Royal Family are prohibited from wearing dark and coloured nail polish. Meghan wore Essie’s Ballet Slippers to the Royal Wedding, which happens to be the Queen’s favourite. We are pretty sure that the colour is here to stay.  5. Travelling with mourning clothes  Ever since the then-Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip had to travel back to England from Africa in regular clothes due to King George’s passing, it is imperative that all royals always travel with a set of funeral clothes in order to be respectful.  6. Perfecting the curtsy  The queen expects female family members, including Kate Middleton and Camilla Parker Bowles, to curtsy when they enter a room in her presence, even when it’s an informal occasion. So, Meghan better get used to the curtsy. If she is at an official event, the Duchess must also curtsy to anyone who outranks her title.  7. Miniskirts – a big no no!    The queen disapproves of hemlines higher than the knee. Regular female visitors such as Kate, Camilla, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie are already aware of the fashion stipulation. If Meghan hasn’t already ditched her little black dresses or her minis, it’s time for her to do so.  8. No crossed legs  It’s frowned upon for Royal family members to cross their legs. You’ll never see Kate crossing her legs anywhere other than at her ankles. It’s time for Meghan to let go of any such habit.  9. No Wedges  Apparently, the Queen is repelled by wedged heels. So if Meghan owns any such pairs, she will have to throw them out immediately! Although Kate has been seen wearing the despised shoes, you will never find a photo of the Duchess of Cambridge rockin’ a wedge in front of her royal highness.  10. Dinnertime is 20:30  When dining with her majesty, Meghan will always have to eat at 8:30pm until 10pm. The Queen is known for strictly adhering to her royal schedule.  Urwa Hocane trolled mercilessly over royal wedding comparison  11. No seating choices    At a Royal family gathering, Meghan will always have to be seated next to Prince Harry.  12. Entering rooms in a particular order    There is a strict code of conduct for how to enter a room when you are with the royals. Here’s the royal order: Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Camilla, Prince William, Kate, Prince Harry and then Meghan.  13. Eating depending on the Queen  Meghan cannot begin eating her meal until the Queen has started hers. The former actor also needs to stop eating as soon as the Queen stops eating, even if there is still food left on the plate.  14. No sleeping until the Queen sleeps  If the newly weds stay at the Queen’s house, they have to stay up until her majesty falls asleep. Apparently it’s considered bad form to call it a night before the monarch.  15. Do not pass go    This may seem like an unusual rule but Monopoly is not allowed. Back in 2008, the Leeds Building Society gave the Duke of York Prince Andrew the board game of Monopoly to which he responded, “We’re not allowed to play Monopoly at home. It gets too vicious.”  16. Pinkies to stay in  Tea time is a very important time for royals. Etiquette expert Myka Meier shared that the correct way to drink tea is to use your thumb and index finger to hold the top of the handle, while the middle finger supports the bottom.  You should also sip from the same spot the entire time so that the rim doesn’t get lipstick stains. If you are a coffee drinker, you should loop your index finger through the handle. But beware—no pinkies out. This is exactly how the royals are expected to drink beverages.  17. No shellfish  It’s an ancient royal tradition to say no to shellfish in order to avoid food poisoning. While the Royal family does not always follow this rule, her royal highness the Queen has apparently never touched shellfish in her entire life.  Have something to add to the story?

Following her solo outing with the Queen earlier this month, it's now being reported that Meghan is about to take over one of Queen Elizabeth's royal duties.

The programme aims to recognize the work of exceptional young people and the work that they do within the Commonwealth nations.

            "text: The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom. The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3]  Announcement of engagement [ edit ]  Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the \"wave of abuse and harassment\" directed toward Markle.[5]  Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8]  The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8]  During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11]  Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17]  Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20]  Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at the Queen's Sandringham estate.[28] The official engagement photographs were taken by Alexi Lubomirski (a former assistant to Mario Testino) at Frogmore House, and were issued by Kensington Palace on 21 December 2017.[29]  To mark the wedding of Harry and Meghan, the Royal Mint produced an official UK £5 coin, showing the couple in profile.[30] In May, a set of commemorative postage stamps, featuring the couple's official engagement photographs, was issued by Royal Mail.[31]  Wedding [ edit ]  Planning [ edit ]  Preparation for wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle  Unlike the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the wedding day of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was not declared a bank holiday.[32] The wedding was on the same date as the FA Cup Final, which Prince Harry's brother William normally attends in his role as President of the Football Association.[33] Holding the royal wedding on a weekend is a break with the royal tradition of having weddings on a weekday.[34] On 12 February 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the ceremony would commence at 12:00 Midday BST.  Venue [ edit ]  The wedding took place on Saturday, 19 May 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor.[35] The chapel had previously been the venue for the weddings of Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as that of his cousin, Peter Phillips, and for the blessing of the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Harry's stepmother.[36]  Cost [ edit ]  The royal family announced that they would pay for the wedding.[37] The costs for the cake, the florist, and the catering had been estimated to be £50,000, £110,000, and £286,000 respectively,[38] and the overall cost was expected to be around £32 million.[39] The security costs were expected to be lower than those of the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.[40] By the end of May, it was estimated that the security costs were \"between £2 million and £4 million\". The police and crime commissioner could also apply for special funding if the costs were to exceed 1% of the Thames Valley Police force's annual budget, but at the time the cost was \"well below the £4 million required to make a claim\".[41] The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead reportedly spent £2.6 million on cleaning the town and roads.[40] It was predicted that the wedding would trigger a tourism boom and boost the economy by up to £500 million.[42]  Wedding attire [ edit ]  The wedding invitations specified a dress code for men of \"Dress Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit\"; for women, \"Day Dress and Hat\".[43]  Bride and bridesmaids [ edit ]  The wedding dress was designed by the British designer Clare Waight Keller under the aegis of the fashion house Givenchy.[44] It was made of \"double-bonded silk cady cushioned by an underskirt in triple silk organza\" and had a boat neckline, long sleeves and sweeping train.[45][46] The silk veil was 16 feet (4.9 m) long and was embroidered with 55 flowers, representing the 53 countries of the Commonwealth,[45][47] as well as Wintersweet, which grows in front of Nottingham Cottage, where she and Harry live, and the California Poppy, the state flower of California.[48] It was secured by a diamond bandeau tiara, made in 1932 for Queen Mary and lent to Markle by Queen Elizabeth II.[45][49] The centre brooch had been a wedding gift from the County of Lincoln in 1893. The tiara is a platinum band, made up of eleven sections, a detachable centre brooch with interlaced opals and diamonds.[50] The shoes were also from Givenchy, and had a pointed couture design.[45]  Other ensembles worn by the bride included white gold and diamond earrings and bracelet made by Cartier.[45][49][51] Markle's hair was rolled up with \"face-framing fringe tucked behind her ears\",[52] and was done by Serge Normant.[53] Make-up artist Daniel Martin did Markle's makeup for the occasion.[52][54] The look was described as \"a soft brown eyeshadow\" with minimal makeup on the face.[52] Her nails were painted in a \"neutral pink-y beige\" for the ceremony.[55] The bride's bouquet, designed by Philippa Craddock, contained \"forget-me-nots, scented sweet peas, lily of the valley, astilbe, jasmine and astrantia, and sprigs of myrtle\".[45] The flowers were chosen by the groom who handpicked forget-me-nots in honour of his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales.[45][56] After the wedding the bridal bouquet was placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey, following royal tradition that began with the Queen Mother.[57] For the customary bridal themes of \"Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue\", Markle had her gown and veil (the \"new\"), the Queen's tiara (the \"borrowed\"), sprigs of myrtle taken from \"a plant grown from the myrtle used in the Queen's wedding bouquet\" and a piece of fabric from Diana, Princess of Wales's wedding gown (the \"old\"), and finally a piece of fabric from the dress she wore on their first date stitched in the veil (the \"blue\").[58][59][60] The young bridesmaids also wore high-waisted silk dresses designed by Clare Waight Keller which had puff sleeves.[61]  Groom, best man and page boys [ edit ]  Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge wore the frock coat uniform of the Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons) in which both were commissioned,[note 3] and Prince Harry served for 10 years, including in combat in Afghanistan.[62] The uniforms were made by Dege & Skinner, gentleman's tailors and uniform makers, of Savile Row, London.[63][64] The groom asked for and received the Queen's permission to keep his beard, as beards are only permitted under exceptional circumstances in the British Army.[62] Prince Harry wore the rank of major with the star of the Royal Victorian Order, of which he is a Knight Commander, along with the ribbons of the Royal Victorian Order, Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan, Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, and Army Air Corps wings.[65] Prince William, also with the rank of major, had EIIR cyphers on his shoulder straps and gold aiguillettes on his right shoulder (indicating his position as an aide-de-camp to the Queen), and wore the star of the Order of the Garter, the ribbons of the two jubilee medals, and his RAF wings.[63][66] The pageboys wore uniforms by Dege & Skinner that resembled the uniform of the Blues and Royals worn by the groom and best man. Each page boy had his initials on the shoulders in place of rank badges.[63]  Wedding party [ edit ]  On 26 April 2018, Kensington Palace announced that Prince Harry had selected his older brother, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, as his best man.[67][68] There was initially no confirmation as to whether Prince William would miss the FA Cup Final, which he would normally attend in his role as President of The Football Association, or if he would be able to attend both the wedding and the football. A statement from Kensington Palace that the timing of the wedding would not clash with the match was released in December 2017.[69] However, it was confirmed in March that the Duke would not be attending the final that day.[70]  There were suggestions that the bride's friend Jessica Mulroney would be her maid of honour.[71][72] In early May 2018, there was confirmation that there would be no maid of honour, and that the bridesmaids and page boys would all be children.[73] A total of ten bridesmaids and page boys were chosen, with the bride and groom each selecting five: two of Markle's godchildren, seven-year old Rylan Ritt and her six-year-old sister Remi, as well as Brian, John and Ivy Mulroney, the three children of her friend Jessica Mulroney, were chosen by the bride, while Prince Harry's nephew and niece, Prince George and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, as well as his godchildren Florence van Cutsem, Zalie Warren and Jasper Dyer, were selected by the groom.[74][75]  On 18 May 2018, Kensington Palace announced Prince Charles would accompany Markle down the aisle, after she confirmed her father, Thomas Markle Sr., would not be attending the wedding due to his recent heart surgery.[76][77] The bride spent the night before the wedding at Cliveden House along with her mother, while the groom stayed at Coworth Park Hotel with his brother.[78][79] Markle made her way to the church accompanied by her mother.[80]  Approximately 250 members of the British Armed Forces were involved in the wedding, the majority coming from units that have a connection with Prince Harry:[81]  Wedding service [ edit ]  The wedding service was conducted according to the Christian liturgy for Holy Matrimony as set out in Common Worship of the Church of England, mother Church of the Anglican Communion.[3]  From 8.00 am, the public started to arrive at the grounds of Windsor Castle. The main congregation and the guests[84] all started to arrive at the chapel at 9.30 am, followed by members of the Royal Family. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were the last members of the Royal Family to depart for the ceremony, as is tradition, arriving at the chapel at 11.52 am.[85] Shortly after, Markle arrived with the party of junior attendants. She proceeded down the aisle followed by the attendants, where the Prince of Wales met her to escort her through the quire of the chapel. He accompanied her to the altar, where Prince Harry was standing.[86][87]  Prince Harry's maternal aunt, Baroness Fellowes, read a scripture lesson from The Song of Solomon in the Christian Bible. The Dean of Windsor, David Conner, conducted the service with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, performing the marriage ceremony. The sermon was delivered by The Most Reverend Michael Curry, presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church (the American member church of the Anglican Communion).[88][89] Curry's 14-minute address, which quoted Martin Luther King Jr., emphasised the redemptive property of love;[90][91] its unexpected length caused the service to overrun by eight minutes.[92] Chaplain to the Queen The Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin and Coptic Orthodox Archbishop of London Anba Angaelos offered the prayers.[93]  The marriage vows were those published in Common Worship, and included the promise to \"to love and to cherish\" each other.[94] This was sealed by the exchange of rings.[94] The wedding rings were created by Cleave and Company, with Markle's ring being fashioned out of Welsh gold and the Prince's ring made of platinum.[95] After the signing of the registers, Harry and Markle together with the guests sang the national anthem. The couple paused briefly to bow and curtsey to the Queen before walking down the aisle.[96] They were followed in procession by other members of the bridal party, and their families.[94] The couple shared a kiss on the steps outside the chapel.[97]  Music [ edit ]  Hymns sung at the wedding included Lord of All Hopefulness and Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer.[98] Prince Harry was seen wiping away a tear during the congregational singing of the latter, which was a favourite of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and was sung at her funeral in 1997;[99] it was also the opening hymn to William's wedding in 2011.  Two choirs, an orchestra, the chapel organ and fanfare trumpeters provided music for the service. The orchestra was made up of musicians from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the English Chamber Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra. In addition to the Choir of St George's Chapel, the Kingdom Choir, a gospel group led by Karen Gibson, sang \"Stand By Me\" in what was described as \"an incredible and powerful moment\".[100] The State Trumpeters of the Household Cavalry, who played a fanfare, included Kate Sandford, the first female state trumpeter at a British royal wedding.[101] The music was under the overall direction of James Vivian, the chapel's Organist and Director of Music; and the orchestra was conducted by Christopher Warren-Green.[102][103]  The bride walked down the aisle to \"Eternal source of light divine\" (from the Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne) by Handel, sung by soprano Elin Manahan Thomas, with the trumpet obbligato performed by David Blackadder.[104] Other music during the service included the motet \"If Ye Love Me\" by Thomas Tallis; the song \"Stand by Me\" by Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller and Ben E. King, arranged for choir by Mark Delisser; and \"The Lord bless you and keep you\" by John Rutter. During the signing of the register, 19-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason and the orchestra played Sicilienne attributed to Maria Theresia von Paradis, Fauré's Après un rêve, and an arrangement for cello and orchestra of Schubert's Ave Maria. For the procession, the musicians performed the Allegro from the Symphony No. 1 in B-flat major by William Boyce and \"This Little Light of Mine\" by Etta James, Jester Hairston and Harry Dixon Loes.[105]  Family celebrations [ edit ]  St George's Hall, Windsor Castle Frogmore House  Following the ceremony, there was a carriage procession through Windsor. Two receptions were held; the first, for those attending the ceremony, was hosted by the Queen and took place in St George's Hall after the carriage procession. Singer Elton John performed for the guests and the groom and the Prince of Wales each gave a speech.[62] A second reception at Frogmore House, for family and close friends and hosted by the Prince of Wales, occurred later in the day.[88] Harry drove his new wife to the reception at Frogmore in a silver blue Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero, with left-hand drive. For the evening reception, the Duchess of Sussex wore a halter-neck, open back dress by Stella McCartney and an emerald cut Aquamarine ring formerly belonging to Diana, Princess of Wales.[106][107] George Northwood was her hairstylist for the private party.[107] In a break with tradition, the bride made a speech at the event.[62] The Duke of Cambridge also gave a best man's speech. DJ Idris Elba and The Atlantic Soul Orchestra performed at the event.[108][109][110] The event ended with small fireworks displayed above Frogmore House.[111]  The wedding cake was a layered lemon and elderflower cake and decorated with peonies in shades of white and cream.[112] The cake designer Claire Ptak, based in London, was chosen in March 2018.[113]  Three official wedding photos were released. They were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski at Windsor Castle following the ceremony.[114]  Guests [ edit ]  In April 2018, it was announced that an \"official list\" of domestic and international political leaders was not required for the wedding and that Prime Minister Theresa May, Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn, and other leaders would not attend the ceremony. President of the United States Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama were also not invited.[115] This was in contrast to the wedding of Prince Harry's elder brother, which had a large number of such guests due to his position as a future monarch.[116] The decision not to invite political leaders to the wedding was taken in part because of the limitations of the venue, and also took into account Prince Harry's position as sixth in line to the throne.[116] The only politician invited was the former Prime Minister Sir John Major as he previously was \"a special guardian on legal matters to Princes William and Harry after the death of their mother\".[62]  With a smaller ceremony and reception at St George's Hall, the guest list included approximately 600 people, most of whom have a \"direct relationship\" with the couple.[117] Also, 200 close friends of the couple were invited to attend the evening reception at Frogmore House.[118] Approximately 1,200 members of the public were invited to greet the couple outside the chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle.[117] The invitees outside the chapel were \"people from charities, Windsor Castle community members, people from the royal households and the Crown Estate, and local school children\".[119]  Sarah, Duchess of York, the former wife of Prince Andrew, was invited to the wedding even though she had not been invited to the weddings of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011, Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly in 2008, or Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall in 2011. However, she was not invited to the evening reception at Frogmore House hosted by Prince Charles and was reportedly \"deeply upset\" by her omission.[120]  Amongst the non-royal guests were Markle's Suits co-stars Patrick J. Adams (with wife Troian Bellisario), Gabriel Macht (with wife Jacinda Barrett), Sarah Rafferty, Rick Hoffman, Gina Torres and Abigail Spencer, actors George Clooney (with wife Amal Clooney), Idris Elba and Tom Hardy, actresses Oprah Winfrey, Priyanka Chopra and Carey Mulligan (with husband Marcus Mumford), television host James Corden, tennis player Serena Williams (with husband Alexis Ohanian), David and Victoria Beckham, musicians Sir Elton John (with husband David Furnish), James Blunt, Joss Stone, and rugby players Jonny Wilkinson and James Haskell. Megan's close friend, stylist Jessica Mulroney (with husband Ben Mulroney) and Harry's ex-girlfriends Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy were also in attendance. Other guests were members of the Middleton family.[121][122][123][124][125]  The only foreign royal guests at the wedding were Prince Harry's friend Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, with whom he co-founded, after the death of both of their mothers, the Sentebale foundation to help AIDS-stricken orphans in Lesotho, and his wife Princess Mabereng.[126]  Gifts for guests [ edit ]  The 2,640 members of the public invited to Windsor Castle for the wedding were gifted gift bags to commemorate the event. The bag had the initials of the couple, date and venue location printed on the exterior. Inside was an order of service booklet for the wedding, a gold chocolate coin, a bottle of water, a fridge magnet, a 20% off voucher for the Windsor Castle gift shop and a tube of handbag shortbread.[127]  Charitable donations [ edit ]  In April 2018, the couple requested that, rather than sending wedding gifts, people should make a donation to one of seven charitable organisations, none of which they had a formal association with:[128][129]  CHIVA (Children's HIV Association): The small charity supports more than 1,000 young people living with HIV in the UK and Ireland.  Crisis: The national homeless body works with thousands of people a year to help rebuild their lives.  The Myna Mahila Foundation: The organisation, based in Mumbai, helps empower women through offering stable employment and breaking cultural taboos around menstrual hygiene. Myna Mahila also teaches women life skills such as maths, English and self-defence.  Scotty's Little Soldiers: The charity supports children who have lost a parent while serving in the British Armed Forces.  StreetGames: The organisation uses sport to help young people and communities become healthier and safer.  Surfers Against Sewage: The national marine conservation body works to protect oceans, beaches, waves and wildlife.  The Wilderness Foundation UK: Vulnerable teenagers from urban communities are taught about the great outdoors and rural employment opportunities.  Coverage [ edit ]  People watching the wedding at the official residence of the UK Ambassador to Italy, in Rome  Peak viewing figures of 18 million were reported in the UK.[130] About 29 million were reported to have watched in the United States, up from the 23 million Americans who watched the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.[131] The global audience was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions.[132]  Coverage of the royal wedding in the UK was shown on BBC One, ITV, Sky News, CNN (International) and E! (Europe) [133] The wedding was also streamed live online on YouTube via the British Monarchy's official The Royal Channel.[134] Huw Edwards hosted coverage for BBC TV with Desert Island Discs host Kirsty Young and BBC Radio 2 DJ Dermot O'Leary. The BBC Radio coverage was co-hosted by Chris Evans and Scarlett Moffatt.[135] Phillip Schofield and Julie Etchingham hosted coverage for ITV.[136] Kay Burley, Anna Botting and Alastair Bruce, among others, hosted coverage for Sky.[137]  CBC broadcast the wedding in Canada with Adrienne Arsenault and retired broadcaster Peter Mansbridge presented live coverage that was simulcast on CBC Television, CBC Radio One and CBC News Network.[138] TVNZ screened it in New Zealand along with SBS and Nine in Australia.[133][139] The wedding received 4 million views in Australia.[140]  In Fiji, Fiji Television broadcast the event via BBC with coverage starting from 8:30 pm FJT on 19 May and finishing at 12:30 am on 20 May, when it switched back to normal programming.  In the United States coverage aired on CBS, NBC, ABC, E!, PBS, BBC America, TLC, FOX, and HBO.[141] CBS's coverage began at 4 a.m. EDT with CBS Presents \"The Royal Wedding\"[142] and Gayle King provided commentary during the broadcast. ABC began its coverage at 5 a.m. EDT with a special edition of Good Morning America.[143] NBC aired the ceremony at 4:30 a.m. EDT with a special edition of The Today Show.[144] The pay subscription network HBO hosted a live broadcast titled \"The Royal Wedding Live with Cord and Tish!\" starting at 7:30 a.m. EDT.[145] The parody hosts were Cord Hosenbeck and Tish Cattigan, the alter egos of former Saturday Night Live actors Will Ferrell and Molly Shannon. BBC America provided a live simulcast of BBC One's coverage, albeit with limited commercial breaks.[146]  The wedding was also aired on the Republic of Ireland's national broadcaster RTÉ.[147]  Comments in a \"posh\" British accent by a self-claimed British expert on some media turned out to be by an American, Thomas Mace-Archer-Mills.[148]  Titles [ edit ]  Traditionally, royal princes have been awarded peerages prior to their marriages; this occurred with both of Prince Harry's uncles, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex, as well as his elder brother, the Duke of Cambridge.[149] Hours before the wedding, Prince Harry was granted the titles Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton, and Baron Kilkeel, and Markle assumed the style \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex\" upon marriage.[1]  Reactions [ edit ]  British reactions to a mixed-race American marrying into the British royal family ( Voice of America  The wedding was widely reported as being significant for its departure from tradition typically associated with the Royal Family and for its inclusion of African-American culture in the service.[150][151][152][153][154] It was described as a \"landmark for African Americans\", for Black British, black and mixed-race women, and for the Royal Family itself.[155][156][157][158] Other reports cited more limited impact, including that \"Markle being biracial as opposed to African American impeded black people embracing her as one of their own\".[159][160]  The wedding, particularly Markle's choice of dress, as well as the cake and flowers, influenced the choices of other British brides for their weddings.[161]  Honeymoon [ edit ]  The couple did not leave for their honeymoon the day after their marriage, and were both scheduled to carry out public engagements in the week after the wedding.[162] The location of the honeymoon has been kept secret, although the press speculated that they might be headed to locations such as Namibia, Rwanda, and Botswana.[163][164][165]  See also [ edit ]\n",

            "text: It's not uncommon for women to lose weight before their wedding days. But tabloids are accusing Meghan Markle of starving herself for the royal wedding, and it's hugely problematic. According to Star, Markle is a \"shadow of her former self,\" and she \"caused a stir\" when she attended an Invictus Games reception with Prince Harry last month because she \"couldn’t hide her frail frame and pin-thin legs.\" Now, the tabloid reported, that she's \"wasting away\" and friends and family are \"fretting\" that she's \"starving herself into emaciation.\"  The fact is that many women work out and change up their diets to feel their healthiest before their nuptials. And this is nothing new. A 2007 Cornell University study found that 70 percent of 272 engaged women said they wanted to lose weight — typically 20 pounds, according to The New York Times.  In the two months of fittings before most clients’ weddings at Kleinfeld Bridal in New York, for example, one seamstress told The New York Times that she's kept busy taking in gowns. That's because brides-to-be say, “I don’t want the size 16; I want the 14 or the 12,’\" Jennette Kruszka, Kleinfeld’s marketing director, reportedly told the outlet in 2007.  But none of this means that these women are starving themselves.  WPA Pool/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Markle's wedding dress also had to be altered several times due to weight loss, according to The Sun, but that doesn't mean that she has been \"starving herself to emancipation\" either. Rather, the article plainly said, \"Like most brides, Meghan has been on a bit of a health kick.\"  Nonetheless, Star reported that an \"insider\" claims she has \"lost a shocking amount of weight in just the last two weeks\" and that she \"seems obsessed with losing even more before the big day.\" The magazine reported that she \"appears to have dropped 23 pounds,\" and claimed that her purported weight loss is the result of a \"drastic diet\" that consists of cleansing juices and ice chips.  Regardless, eating disorders are no joke, and throwing around accusations about them is totally uncalled for. Anorexia is the third most common chronic disease among young people, after asthma and type 1 diabetes, according to the National Eating Disorders Association. Between 0.9 percent and 2 percent of females will develop anorexia in their lifetimes. And, at any given point in time, 1 percent of young women will meet diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa.  And many brides-to-be do indeed suffer from eating disorders. According to Shape, many women get so caught up in losing weight that it becomes unhealthy. A report from Moneyish actually suggested that \"proposal shape\" is the latest fitness trend that encourages people to double down on their usual workout and diet habits so that they'll be \"fit enough\" for the proposal and, eventually, the wedding. Thanks, unrealistic beauty standards!  The actress will marry Prince Harry on Saturday, according to Express, and she may actually be aiming to feel healthy and fit for the important day through a certain exercise, \"royal expert\" Julie Montagu reportedly told the outlet.  Montagu holds the official title of Viscountess Hinchingbrooke, since she married Luke Montagu, Viscount of Hinchingbrooke. She is also a London-based yoga teacher, and she reportedly told Express that Markle has been practicing yoga to get herself ready for the wedding.  Regardless of how Markle chooses to prepare for her wedding day, it's about time we stop body shaming women for both their weight gain and their weight loss. So long as Markle is healthy (and she's got a fiancé and a royal family to look out for her there), it's no one's business what size she'll be wearing.\n",

            "text: The Duchess of Sussex has joined her husband and the Queen for the Queen's Young Leaders Awards in Buckingham Palace. This marks her first time attending the ceremony, which honors young people for leadership and service in their communities.  For the event, Meghan Markle donned a light pink Prada short sleeve top and skirt set adorned with double-breasted button down the front. The Italian designer is a departure from her go-to label, Givenchy, who she previously wore at royal events including her wedding to Prince Harry. She accessorized today's look with black Aquazzura pumps and a Prada clutch.

It's the latest in impressive looks from the Duchess, who continues to impress even without a stylist, Vanity Fair reports. However, she does get style advice from Prince Harry, who occasionally weighs in on her looks.  YouTube  Getty Images  The Duchess sat intently in the front row as her husband gave a speech and while the Queen honored the young recipients. As the Duke of Sussex addressed the crowd, he mentioned that his wife would be joining in on the work.  \"I, together with my wife Meghan, look forward to convening young people from around The Commonwealth to hear your ideas, work with you to build platforms for you to collaborate and form partnerships, as we travel around in our work, he said, per royal commentator Omid Scobie.  Getty Images  Today's awards also marks another event hosted by the Queen and Markle, following their day of joint engagements in Chester, England earlier this month. That time, however, Prince Harry wasn't present.  Aside from official business, Markle has also attended events with the Queen and the rest of the royal family, such as the Royal Ascot last week and Trooping the Colour, which honors Her Majesty's birthday, earlier this month.  The @QueensLeaders award winners arrive in the ballroom: pic.twitter.com/avQEhtf0Ay — Emily Nash (@emynash) June 26, 2018  The Queen's Young Leaders Awards were created in 2014 to honor exceptional young people across the 52 nations of the Commonwealth, according to the royal family's website. Hundreds of people apply every year. By now, the program has created a community of 240 individuals.  Her Majesty awards the recipients with medals then hosts a reception at Buckingham Palace. At last year's awards, a dinner followed at London's Australia House, which Prince Harry attended. Perhaps this time Markle will be by his side.

We've met her family, know all about her flawless fashion, applauded her enviable career, and now, as she prepares to become Prince Harry's wife this weekend, we can't help but wonder what Meghan Marke's dating rap sheet looks like? While we all know who Prince Harry's ex-girlfriends are (looking at you, Chelsy Davy and Cressida Bonas) – Meghan's love life history is still as mysterious as the Crown Jewels. Just last week the mother of all bombshells dropped when it was reported Meghan went on a date with porn star Simon Rex in 2004 when she was an aspiring actress. He's since come out and said it never took off due to his \"garlic breath.\" Obsessed with the royals? Like our Facebook page Now To Love Royals for the latest news on your favourite royal family members!  So, garlic breath is obviously not on the agenda but what does Meghan Markle look for in a significant other exactly? \"At the end of the day, if the guy is going to write the girl a letter, whether it's chicken scratch or scribble or looks like a doctor's note, if he takes the time to put pen to paper and not type something, there's something so incredibly romantic and beautiful about that,\" she's told Esquire magazine in 2013. Well, Prince Harry certainly put pen to paper last year when he dropped a ground-breaking statement begging for the media to leave Meghan alone.  We all know who Prince Harry's exes are!  Seeing the world with her man is also a must. \"I always want off-the-beaten-path, Anthony Bourdain-inspired travel,\" she's mused. From Jamaica to Africa, Scotland and everywhere in between, this year alone Meghan and Harry have racked up a hefty collection of stamps on their passport. As for what it takes to sweep her off her feet? She insists a good old-fashioned slice of pizza is the way to her heart - us too Meegs, us too! \"I've had dates at the nicest restaurants, but when you leave, you're starving, and the best part of the date is having a slice of pizza and a couple of drinks on the way home. I think it's important to be able to roll with the punches and enjoy every minute of it.\" Well, now we know what kind of man Meghan likes let's take a step back in time and get to know her former flames...  The one before the one: Canadian chef, Cory Vitiello, 2014-2016  Break-ups always suck, so spare a thought for poor old Cory Vitiello, who was reportedly given the flick shortly after Meghan met Harry in 2016. A besotted Meghan even featured Cory on her now defunct lifestyle blog The Tig, but the post has since been removed. The [UK Telegraph] claims the Suits star was an item with the successful celebrity chef for two years and they were together when Meghan hit it off with Harry in July, 2016. At the time, a friend close of the exes addressed speculation Harry could have played a part in their demise, saying: \"I can't comment on that.\" Just before they broke up, Cory praised his significant other for working with World Vision. \"So proud of my lady @meghanmarkle being named Global Ambassador for @worldvision #worldwaterday,\" he penned.  Cory and Meghan lived together in Toronto and were said to be together when Meghan first met Harry.  But was it always just going to be a flash in the pan? \"They were a very handsome pair and well suited, but you got the impression it was a sometimes superficial relationship,\" an insider revealed to The Daily Mail. \"Cory was always very focused on his job and his work. In that respect, they both put their careers first. The relationship came second.\"  A celebrity chef who can cook a mean carbonara? Almost as good as a Prince!  According to The Daily Mail Meghan, who lived with the foodie in a townhouse in Toronto, was \"going through a tough time with her previous boyfriend\" when Prince Harry \"besieged her with texts until she agreed to a date.\" But don't worry about Cory, he's doing just fine! The gun cook is a regular guest star on lifestyle shows and runs a string of successful restaurants in Toronto. \"There's no downside to being a well-known chef. There are thousands of great cooks in the city, and there are chefs who are more deserving of the celebrity than myself,\" he told Toronto Life in 2016 of his high profile. WATCH: Cory talks about his career. Post continues...  The fleeting fling: Irish pro golfer, Rory McIlroy, 2014  Before Cory, there was a Rory! Though never officially confirmed, these two were joined at the hip for a hot second back in August, 2014. Relive their ice bucket challenge video in the player below. Post continues below...  Their ice bucket video was a hole in one! But nothing serious ever eventuated between the actress and the pro golfer.  Romance rumours stepped up a notch after Meghan and Rory starred in a very flirty ice bucket challenge video together. They were also spotted enjoying several cosy dinner dates in New York and Dublin but sources at the time denied their romance to the Irish Independent  After this pic of Meghan and Rory was posted on Instagram, people were convinced they were a couple.  The ex-husband: American film producer, Trevor Engelson, 2004-2013  We like our princesses to be modern and relatable. And Meghan's failed marriage to American producer Trevor Engelson, 41, makes us love her even more – because in this day and age, who seriously hasn't had a doomed relationship. After dating for six years, Meghan and Trevor, who owns his own production company called Underground, became engaged in 2010. In September, 2011, they tied the knot in an extravagant beach-side wedding at the Jamaica Inn in Ocho Rios, Jamaica. There were over 100 guests in attendance and the celebrations kicked on for days (hopefully she'll do something just as fun with Harry.) Their marriage lasted just two years and by September, 2013 they had quietly separated. Sources close to the couple claim Meghan's role on Suits, which is filmed in Toronto, played a part in their demise. \"It put a strain on the relationship. Trevor was in LA making movies, Meghan was in another country five hours' flight away and it simply took its toll,\" a friend told The Daily Mail. Most recently, Trevor was apparently set to cash in on his marriage to a could-be-potential princess with the explosive news he's working on a TV show with a very familiar plot line. According to Deadline, the show, which is not yet titled, will be based on an American divorced mother who moves to London to marry a British Prince. It will reportedly explore the difficulties of sharing custody with the royal family when your ex-wife is married to a Prince. Although the exes don't share any kids, the controversial concept was dreamt up after Trevor was chatting to his fellow producer Dan Farah, speculating what it would have been like if they did have to share custody of children.  \"Me and my lady in London,\" Trevor penned back in 2010 next to this snap. The film producer married Meghan in 2011.\n",

The word arrives a day after news broke of her engagement to Prince Harry of Wales.  This certainly doesn’t come as a surprise. Two weeks ago, it was reported that she and fellow original cast member Patrick J. Adams would depart once their contracts were up at the end of the upcoming season, and Markle noted in her joint interview with Prince Harry that she was leaving acting behind. There is no word yet if Adams will remain past season 7.  For the past seven seasons, Markle played the tenacious Rachel Zane, an ambitious paralegal who eventually became a full fledged lawyer at the show’s central law firm. Along the way, Rachel began dating and eventually got engaged to the firm’s wonder-boy, Mike Ross (Adams).  USA Network and Universal Cable Productions released the following statement: “From all of us at USA Network and Universal Cable Productions, we want to send our most heartfelt congratulations to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry on their engagement. Meghan has been a member of our family for seven years and it has been a joy to work with her.

They come from stems in the gardens at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, first planted by Queen Victoria in 1845. The sprigs in Meghan’s bouquet come are from a plant grown from the same myrtle used in Queen Elizabeth’s wedding bouquet in 1947.  The royal tradition of placing myrtle in a bridal bouquet dates back to Queen Victoria’s reign. Prince Albert’s grandmother gave Victoria a nosegay containing myrtle.

            "text: GETTY Elephants at watering hole  It may not sound as if we’re heading out on a wild South African adventure but this is how our safari begins. We’re wrapped up all warm and cosy in a Land Cruiser while our guide, wearing nothing more than shorts and a T-shirt, turns and asks what we want to see. Lets go find some cats, we say. As the sun rises we bound off into Kruger National Park on a jeep convoy.  Thousands of animals roam this vast space, an area roughly the size of Scotland. While the park is home to 147 species, the main draw is the Big Five – that’s lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo. Picking our way through the bush it’s difficult to spot anything. There are rustles and strange sounds in the long grass but I can’t see any animals. The tracker perched on the bonnet with his rifle is much better at it. Despite (and very probably because of) being at risk of predators, he seems to notice the smallest of movements in the distance – he’s an expert at finding exotic shapes, everything from hippos and lone giraffes to zebras.  African wildlife up close and personal Mon, June 6, 2016 Penny Robartes, a Photo Tour Leader for ORYX captured these stunning up close and personal wildlife images. www.oryxphotography.com Play slideshow Penny Robartes, ORYX 1 of 17 As a wildlife photographer, I constantly have to be aware of the scene around the subject I'm wanting to photograph. The background is as important as the animal. Arriving at the scene of sleeping lions, I was very aware of the beautiful colours behind hi  Every now and again we stop to look at footprints and even fresh poop.  The main draw is the Big Five – that’s lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo  It looks like elephants passed through overnight. The rangers can read what direction they took and even how long ago. Soon enough, we gasp and nudge each other as he sights a leopard through the trees. It’s hunting something that we can’t make out. Impressed to find it stalking prey, we sit watching in silence. We see another safari vehicle and they report there are elephants near the river so we decide to leave our hungry feline to hunt alone.  NATALIE CHALK Nathalie Chalk on safari  The ground is dry and cracked due to a two-year drought, which has left parts of the park looking scorched with dead trees and uprooted branches. It’s hard to see how anything could thrive in this landscape. Yet as we approach the river, it’s like we enter a different country. There are lush mahogany and marula fruit trees – a favourite snack of the park’s vast herds of elephants. And this is where we find once such group.  GETTY The main draw is the Big Five – that’s lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo  On the banks are 30 elephants, including babies, close to their mothers, young bulls jumping on each other and adult males spraying water. It’s like being backstage on a David Attenborough documentary – peeking into their secret lives off-camera. As our guide talks quietly about how an elephant’s ear resembles the shape of Africa, they begin to stroll our way. The herd is making its way to the road and coming straight towards the vehicle. It’s an uncomfortable mixture of excitement and terror. As we look at them, they stare back. Some of us get nervous. We hold our breath, grit our teeth and fall silent as they get closer. I am about to be nuzzled by the largest land animal on Earth.  I wish I had good rapport with nature. Instead I want to slide down the seat in front and hide under my blanket. Before turning to stone, I remember thinking what long eyelashes they have. Soon we are surrounded as they cross behind and in front. Some swing their trunks, which is how they smell, while others walk by munching on prickly branches. It’s the mother who stands guard. The guide tells us not to worry but we’re not convinced.  SABI SABI The Bush Lodge at Sabi Sabi Private Game Reserve  He speaks in a calm voice to the elephants saying the baby is safe and they can pass. He’d better know what he’s doing, I pray. The ploy works and after 40 minutes, the herd strides off at their own slow pace. When they are far away enough, we all breathe out. Now that was worth getting up for. We’re welcomed back to safety of Bush Lodge at Sabi Sabi Private Game Reserve just before 10am with warm face cloths and drinks. Being on a game drive can make you hungry so I have a three-course feast, filling up at the buffet, ordering eggs benedict and washing it down with a glass of bubbly and a muffin to celebrate our once-ina-lifetime experience.  WIREIMAGE Prince Harry stayed at the Bush Lodge at Sabi Sabi Private Game Reserve earlier this year  The lodge is a labour of love for managers Lauren and her husband Rod who take care of a cluster of 25 fi ve-star suites all offering panoramas of the bush. Inside, it has an Out Of Africa feel with its thatched roof, wooden tables and animal artefacts on the walls. It’s no wonder Prince Harry stayed here earlier this year. Everyone though is treated like royalty with guides escorting you back to your room each night. You couldn’t be closer to wildlife, with baboons swinging from the furniture and impalas on the doorstep. The next morning the birds act as our wake-up call. We bounce along the plains spotting a skipping baby rhino with its mother.  It wasn’t until the afternoon drive that we’d get to see all of the Big Five. As we head back to camp, word comes over the radio of a lion killing a buffalo. We arrive in darkness to watch the mother at work. With Sabi Sabi we don’t share our finds with other safari tours. As a private reserve, it has its own plot of the park, which if we duck under the branches, we can drive off road to follow animals. Visitors on a self-drive on Kruger’s public roads must stick to the tracks. Dinner back at the lodge is served under the stars at a boma (an enclosure traditionally used for livestock) with a barbecue.  SABI SABI Everyone is treated like royalty at the lodge\n",

            "text: About The Duchess of Cambridge The Duchess of Cambridge, born Catherine Elizabeth Middleton, married Prince William at Westminster Abbey in April 2011. Their Royal Highnesses have three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. The family's official residence is Kensington Palace. As well as undertaking royal duties in support of The Queen, both in the UK and overseas, The Duchess devotes her time to supporting a number of charities and organisations. Children's mental health The Duchess of Cambridge is a committed champion of issues related to children’s mental health and emotional wellbeing. Her Royal Highness has worked to bring wider public attention to the fact that issues facing children today such as addiction, poverty, abuse, neglect, loss and illness of family members, can have a long-lasting and traumatic impact if left unsupported. In particular she has highlighted the need for open and honest conversations about the subject to try and combat stigma, and also the importance of early intervention mental health support for young people, to tackle these issues at the earliest possible stage, so that children have the brightest possible futures, as they deserve. It is our duty, as parents and as teachers, to give all children the space to build their emotional strength and provide a strong foundation for their future The Duchess of Cambridge Heads Together In 2017 The Duchess spearheaded the Heads Together mental health campaign with The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, leading a coalition of eight mental health charity partners to change the national conversation on mental health. The campaign aimed to build on existing progress nationwide in tackling stigma, raising awareness, and providing vital help for people with mental health problems. The team of charities covered a wide range of mental health issues that are close to The Duke and Duchess and Prince Harry's passions. They were: Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families; Best Beginnings; CALM – The Campaign Against Living Miserably; Contact (a military mental health coalition); Mind; Place2Be; The Mix; YoungMinds. Heads Together was privileged to be the 2017 Virgin Money London Marathon Charity of the Year giving the campaign a positive platform to raise funds for the charity partners and to start millions of conversations about mental wellbeing. Addiction Through her work with Action on Addiction, The Duchess of Cambridge was struck by the fact that children of addicts are twice as likely to go on to become addicts themselves. In 2013, The Duchess of Cambridge launched M-PACT Plus, an initiative to support children, parents and families affected by parental drug and alcohol misuse, with the aim of providing early specialist support to children to prevent these inevitable outcomes. The project involves training school staff to identify children affected by a parent's drug or alcohol misuse. It then brings families together to work with trained practitioners. The project was convened at Her Royal Highness's request by her own charity The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Children's palliative care The Duchess of Cambridge is a committed supporter of children’s hospices and wider palliative care, which provides a vital lifeline to children and families affected by life-limiting conditions. Through her Royal engagements, charitable patronages and in speeches, she has worked to bring wider public attention to the hospice movement, and the holistic services they offer to families. The Duchess of Cambridge has been publicly involved in this area since she became Royal Patron of East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices (EACH) in January 2012. She has supported their major fundraising efforts to build a new children's hospice The Nook, in Norfolk. Royal patronages The Duchess is Patron of 13 organisations, where she feels her support can make a difference. These broadly reflect her interests in supporting the most vulnerable families and young people, promoting opportunities though sport, and showcasing national institutions. As their Royal Patron, The Duchess will back their key projects and initiatives, spotlight their work through her programme of official engagements and where appropriate by convening organisations to work in support of each other. The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry In addition to supporting charities and organisations, The Duchess of Cambridge, like her husband and Prince Harry, is able to direct her own philanthropic work through The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. The Royal Foundation develops programmes and charitable projects based on the interests of Their Royal Highnesses by working with organisations which are already making a proven impact in their respective fields. The Royal Foundation provides additional investment, mentoring, support and partnerships for these programmes, and lends its own profile and leverage to enhance the effect of their good work.  Biography The Duchess of Cambridge became a member of the Royal Family in 2011, upon her marriage to Prince William. Since that time, she has taken on Royal duties in support of The Queen through engagements at home and overseas, alongside a portfolio of charitable work and patronages. The Duchess's charitable work is driven by a personal desire to help make a difference in some key areas, where she feels her support can help. In recent years, The Duchess has drawn attention to the importance of supporting the mental health and emotional wellbeing of children, the impact of addiction on children and families, and the necessary measures to support children suffering from family breakdown. Early life Catherine Elizabeth Middleton was born to Michael and Carole Middleton at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, on 9 January 1982. The Duchess is the eldest of three children. The Duchess of Cambridge was christened at the parish church of St. Andrew’s Bradfield in Berkshire on 20 June 1982.

Their official residence is at Kensington Palace.  Supporting The Queen The Duchess of Cambridge works in support of The Queen in carrying out Royal duties both at home and overseas. She has been hugely inspired by the leadership The Queen has provided for over 60 years and will continue to play her part in supporting and celebrating The Queen in the UK and around the Commonwealth wherever possible. The Duchess of Cambridge supports The Queen and the Royal Family in a number of ways. Her Royal Highness regularly undertakes Royal engagements in towns and cities across the United Kingdom, joining The Queen and other members of the Royal Family on occasions. She also plays a full role at annual Royal events. These include: • Garden Parties at Buckingham Palace  • Celebrating The Queen's official birthday at Trooping the Colour  • Joining members of the Royal Family in welcoming Heads of State on State Visits to the UK  • The Remembrance Day ceremony at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London Remembrance The Duchess of Cambridge joined her husband and members of the Royal Family to lead moments of national commemoration for the two World Wars in Europe. Together The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Arromanches in June 2014 where they met veterans and their families. They also led the August 2014 services commemorating the centenary of the First World War in Liege, joining Prince Harry at a service in Saint Symphorien cemetery near Mons, Belgium. In 2016, The Duchess of Cambridge joined other members of the Royal Family at events in France to mark the centenary of the Battle of the Somme. In July 2017, The Duchess joined The Duke of Cambridge and The King and Queen of the Belgians at the commemorations to mark the centenary of Passchendaele – The Third Battle of Ypres, in Belgium. Royal tours The Duchess of Cambridge has carried out a number of overseas visits with her husband including to Realm and Commonwealth nations on behalf of The Queen, or to undertake an official tour to represent Britain at the request of the Government. The Duchess's first official overseas tour was to Canada in July 2011. For their second tour, in 2012 The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited Malaysia, Singapore, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu as part of Her Majesty The Queen's Diamond Jubilee year celebrations. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, with Prince George, then visited New Zealand and Australia in Spring 2014, followed by New York in December 2014. The Duke and Duchess visited India, Bhutan and Canada in 2016 and Paris, Poland and Germany in 2017. The Duchess made solo visits to the Netherlands in October 2016 and, at the request of Her Majesty's Government, to Luxembourg in May 2017 to participate in the official commemoration of the 1867 Treaty of London. During the visit, Her Royal Highness also attended a series of engagements to celebrate the cultural and historic ties between the UK and Luxembourg. National sporting events The Duchess of Cambridge, herself a keen sportswoman, also represents the Royal Family at major national sporting events to reflect the nation's support, in particular when Great Britain is acting as the host nation of a major event. Along with Prince Harry, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were Official Ambassadors for Team GB and Paralympic GB in the lead up to, and during, the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Again at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014, Their Royal Highnesses joined the thousands of fans watching the sports at the venues and also meeting the athletes. They joined forces again in 2014 to witness the spectacular Tour de France Grand Depart in Yorkshire, where they signalled the start of the race, and in 2015 supported Prince Harry in his role as President of the Rugby World Cup. The Duchess is an enthusiastic tennis fan and has regularly attended the Wimbledon Championships, including the men's final in 2014 and 2016, and the semi-final in 2015. At the end of The Queen's 90th birthday year, in 2016, Her Majesty stepped down as Patron from a number of national organisations – at this time The Duchess of Cambridge became Patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club (AELTC) Wimbledon and the Lawn Tennis Association. The Duchess's first visit to The Championships as Patron of the AELTC was in July 2017.\n",

            "text: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been pretty clear about their desire to start a family eventually. But a new report from Us Weekly has it that the timeline for baby #1 has become accelerated after the royal wedding. Multiple sources have told the outlet that after the ceremony, the two's desire for having kids grew. “Having children is definitely a priority,” a source close to Markle told Us. “She and Harry want to start a family right away—and she’ll start trying as soon as she can.”  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  A second source that the outlet describes as a royal insider echoed this, though was a little less \"this'll happen ASAP.\" “They both can’t wait to start a family. [Still,] Harry and Meghan won’t rush into anything. They have a lot on their plate right now. But they both think that when the moment feels right, that will be the time to go for it. They’ll make fantastic parents.”  A third source chimed in that even Markle's mom Doria Ragland believes that baby will come soon. “Doria is expecting to be a grandmother by this time next year. She’s very excited for Meghan to become a mother.”  Harry and Markle are currently believed to be on their honeymoon, though they are expected to attend the Queen's Trooping of the Colour official birthday parade this Saturday. They have a trip planned to Australia this fall for the Sydney Invictus Games and are said to have a busy second half of the year coming with work engagements. Whether a pregnancy announcement will come before or after all that, we'll see.  In their first interview together after announcing their engagement, Markle and Harry made it clear they hope to have children someday. When asked about their plans to start a family, Harry said, \"No [not now], of course, you know, one step at a time. Hopefully we’ll start a family in the near future.\"  At an event in March, Markle hinted that future is nearer rather than farther. The two met a wife-husband entrepreneur duo Sinead and Adam Murphy, who showed the couple products from their Shnuggle line, which include a baby bath and Moses basket. Markle quipped to them, \"I’m sure at some point we’ll need the whole thing.”\n",

            "text: At 91 years old, Queen Elizabeth II has a laundry list of accolades to her name, including the world’s longest-ruling and oldest monarch. She’s also the richest member of the British royal family — by a long shot.  Royal family finances can be complicated, as many details of their fortune are kept private. But it’s fair to say that Queen Elizabeth and the royal family’s net worth is in the tens of billions — around $88 billion as of 2017, according to Forbes. Since the royal family’s jobs aren’t like the average person, how do they make all their money? The short answer: much of the royal family lives off trusts like the Crown Estate, which is owned by the reigning monarch and includes real estate properties like Buckingham Palace.  Some of the royal family’s wealth also comes from a portfolio of extravagant personal collections. The British monarchy owns billions of dollars in property alone, including Balmoral Castle, where the Queen spends every summer, The Savoy in London, a horse racetrack and an entire London street. The crown also owns one of the largest art collections in the world and the Crown Jewels collection, which is made up of more than 140 individual pieces and estimated to be worth at least $4 billion.  Royal obsession, which neared fever pitch this spring as the world prepared for the arrival of Kate Middleton’s third baby, Prince Louis Arthur Charles, and the marriage of Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, is thought to generate approximately £1.8 billion, or about $2.5 billion, for the U.K. economy every year. (That number is likely even higher this year because of Prince Harry and Meghan’s May wedding.)  Here’s what you need to know about each member of the royal family’s net worth:  Queen Elizabeth II net worth  Queen Elizabeth II visits the Royal College Of Physicians on February 20, 2018 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images Chris Jackson—Getty Images  Queen Elizabeth II enjoys a number of royal perks — particularly her substantial wealth. The 91-year-old Queen Elizabeth’s net worth is estimated to be at least $520 million by Wealth-X, a global wealth insights firm. The firm also estimated the royal family’s net worth (Prince Philip and their children) to land at least $1.1 billion.  The queen’s net worth comes in part from a percentage of profits generated by the Crown Estate, which earned about £328.8 million pounds, or $459.25 million, in the 2016-2017 calendar year, according to its annual report. Queen Elizabeth gets a percentage of that profit — called the “Sovereign Grant” — which is set to increase from 15% to 25% over the next 10 years, in part to pay for renovations at Buckingham Palace that will be completed over the next decade. The queen also collects a salary from the Duchy of Lancaster, which is separate from the Crown Estate and is a private and independent income reserved for the Duke of Lancaster, which is the queen.  Queen Elizabeth also owns real estate like the $140 million Balmoral Castle, a holiday home for the Royal Family that is featured on the back of Scotland’s £100 notes, and the $65 million Sandringham House in the English countryside, which the Queen inherited from her father. Both of these are private properties that have stayed within the Royal Family for years and are not part of the Crown Estate or other estates associated with the crown.  Prince Philip net worth  Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh attends the 2017 Braemar Highland Gathering at The Princess Royal and Duke of Fife Memorial Park on September 2, 2017 in Braemar, Scotland. Samir Hussein—Samir Hussein/WireImage Samir Hussein—Samir Hussein/WireImage  Prince Philip — Queen Elizabeth’s husband of 70 years and the Duke of Edinburgh — also enjoys the wealth and perks that come with being a member of the royal family. While WealthX did not provide a net worth for Prince Philip, it has been reported it falls around $30 million.  Under the Sovereign Grant Act of 2011, Prince Philip received an annual Parliamentary annuity of £359,000 pounds, or around $500,234, “to meet the expenses of carrying out his public duties in support of the Queen.” Those duties included attending public events alongside the queen and alone, as well as giving speeches. At an event in March 2016, Prince Philip once joked he was the “world’s most expensive plaque-unveiler.”  The Duke of Edinburgh retired from his royal position in August 2017 at the age of 96, with the “full support of the Queen,” the palace said in a statement at the time. His retirement from the role came after he was admitted to the hospital in the summer of 2017 as a “precautionary measure” due to a pre-existing condition, though Buckingham Palace did not provide specifics for his retirement.  Prince Charles net worth  Prince Charles, Prince of Wales meets local school children in the village of Ramsbury on December 15, 2017 in Marlborough, England. Anwar Hussein—WireImage Anwar Hussein—WireImage  Long the heir to the throne, Prince Charles’s net worth is estimated to be around $400 million, according to Wealth-X. Charles, also known as the Prince of Wales, makes most of his money through the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate that funds the activities of whoever holds the title of Prince of Wales and his family.  Between March 2016 to March 2017, Prince Charles received £16.6 million, or $22.9 million, from the Duchy of Cornwall, according to the estate’s most recent financial statement. The Duchy of Cornwall has £1 billion, or $1.3 billion, in total assets. The estate itself owns a vast amount of land and real estate, predominately in southwest England, including cottages, countryside homes, barn conversions, sea-side estates and even some properties available for rent.  The Duchy of Cornwall was established in 1337 by Edward II with the intention of providing an income to the future Princes of Wales. The estate currently funds not only Prince Charles’ expenses but also those of his family, which includes Prince Charles, his wife Camilla, and his sons Prince William and Prince Harry and their wives Kate, Duchess of Cambridge and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.  Once married to the late Princess Diana, mother to both Prince William and Prince Harry, Prince Charles has donated his wealth over the years to charities and aid projects through the Prince of Wales’s Charitable Foundation. The organization has awarded more than £52 million, or $72.5 million, in grants over the last 10 years, according to the charity’s website. Prince Charles’s charity halved its donations in the most recently reported year, giving £3.1 million, or $4.3 million, in 2017, compared to £7.7 million, or $10.7 million, in 2016, according to The Guardian.  One of the most recent beneficiaries of the foundation was Tusk, an organization founded to challenge poaching in Africa, which Prince William and Prince Harry worked with before.  Prince William net worth  Britain's Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, at the 2018 Centrepoint Awards at Kensington Palace on February 8, 2018 in London, England. WPA Pool—Getty Images WPA Pool—Getty Images  Prince William and Prince Harry have similar net worths, having both inherited the fortune amassed by their late mother, Princess Diana. Both brothers are believed to be worth somewhere between $25 and $40 million, according to Business Insider.  The two brothers each reportedly received the inheritance from their mother in a lump sum of approximately £10 million ($14 million) when they turned 30 years old, Koenig said. They also each started receiving dividends of $450,000 each year upon turning 25, according to Forbes.  William and Harry do not have to pay for official expenses related to their royal duties, such as travel for official visits, staff costs and wardrobe, which are are all financed by The Duchy of Cornwall. In 2017, the Duchy reported spending $4.9 million total to cover the official duties of Harry, Meghan, William and Kate, expenses that are paid in part through the Duchy’s annual revenue.  Prince William, who is second in line to the throne after his father, used to receive an annual salary of $62,000 for his work as an East Anglian Air Ambulance pilot, which he used to donate to charity, according to CNBC. He retired from his job flying rescue helicopters last summer to focus more on his royal duties.  Prince Harry net worth  Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex wave as they leave Windsor Castle after their wedding to attend an evening reception at Frogmore House, hosted by the Prince of Wales on May 19, 2018 in Windsor, England. Steve Parsons - WPA Pool/Getty Images  Prince Harry’s net worth is similar to his brother’s, in part because they both inherited the same amount of money from Princess Diana’s estate. Harry’s wealth is estimated to be at least $25 million, according to Wealth-X, though other estimates put Prince Harry’s net worth as high as $40 million.  Like his brother and sister-in-law, Prince Harry gets to save the majority of his inheritance because The Duchy of Cornwall covers the same expenses. Both Prince Harry and Prince William also inherited Princess Diana’s private jewels, though their value is not known, according to Koenig.  Prince Harry served in the Royal Air Force for 10 years, working his way up to captain, and making about $53,000 a year, Forbes reports. He retired from service in 2015, saying he wanted to devote more time to philanthropic work like the Invictus Games, which hosts international adaptive sports competitions for injured veterans.  He wed American actress Meghan Markle in May at Windsor Castle, and experts estimated their wedding cost about as much Will and Kate’s 2011 nuptials — around $34 million, mainly due to the security needed for the high-profile event.  Kate Middleton net worth  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, greets members of the crowd as she visits The Fire Station, one of Sunderland's most iconic buildings, on February 21, 2018 in Sunderland, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images Chris Jackson—Getty Images  Kate Middleton, who became the Duchess of Cambridge after marrying Prince William in April 2011, also has official royal expenses covered by the Duchy of Cornwall. Kate’s personal net worth is believed to be somewhere around $10 million, Business Insider reported, though the exact number is not known.  Although Kate is the first person outside a royal bloodline to join the royal family, her finances are anything but common. Middleton’s family runs a successful online mail-order party supply store, Party Pieces. Koenig says her parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, have been reported to be worth somewhere between $30 to $50 million, though the exact amount is not known.  “There is no way in knowing if the Duchess’ parents have set up trusts for their three children,” she said. But we can assume that Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, will inherit their parents money eventually, she said.  Kate has three children with William — Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 2, and Prince Louis, a boy who was born on April 23.  Meghan Markle net worth  Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex travel in the Ascot Landau Carriage during their carriage procession after their wedding on May 19, 2018 in Windsor, England. Among the guests were 2200 members of the public, the royal family and Ms. Markle's Mother, Doria Ragland. Nick Edwards - WPA Pool/Getty Images  Meghan Markle, who became the Duchess of Sussex after marrying Prince Harry this year, may have the smallest bank account of her new (royal) family, but she’s still done well for herself with an estimated net worth of $5 million.  Most of Meghan’s net worth comes from her acting career before her 2017 engagement to Prince Harry. Meghan was paid $50,000 per episode on Suits, making her annual salary for the USA Network drama around $450,000, according to Fortune, but she left the show when she moved to the U.K. to live with Prince Harry. Meghan earned additional income from smaller film roles throughout her acting career.  The 36-year-old former Suits actress receives the same financial perks as her new sister-in-law, Kate. Meghan’s expenses related to all official royal business, including wardrobe, are paid for by the Duchy of Cornwall.  Despite only being married in May, Meghan has already joined Prince Harry for numerous royal engagements and begun her official royal duties. She has said she wants to dive into charity work through the Royal Foundation, having previously worked on United Nations campaigns for women’s rights.  Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis net worths  Princess Charlotte of Cambridge and Prince George of Cambridge look on from the balcony during the annual Trooping The Colour parade at the Mall on June 17, 2017 in London, England. Karwai Tang—WireImage Karwai Tang—WireImage  At just 4, 2 and less than a year old Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis are destined for a life of wealth and royalty.  Prince William and Kate Middleton’s first two children both already have relatively lavish lives — they attend two of the most impressive, and expensive, preschools in London. Prince George, who is third in line for the throne, attends Thomas’s Battersea — a $24,000-a-year- preschool that is touted as “the best English education money can buy.” Fourth in line for the throne, Princess Charlotte goes to the Willcocks Nursery School, a female-run preschool with a $14,000-a-year tuition.  Both Prince George and Princess Charlotte are expected to have a large impact on the British economy, according to branding valuation company Brand Finance, CNNMoney reported. Princess Charlotte is expected to have inspired $5 billion in economic activity while Prince George is expected to generate $3.6 billion, according to Brand Finance.

            "text: Wedded bliss!  During Meghan Markle‘s first royal engagement without Prince Harry, her royal husband wasn’t far from her mind.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Prince Harry is the “best husband ever,” Meghan proclaimed with a smile on Thursday.  The ecstatic newlywed royal, 36, told well-wishers she was “really enjoying” married life as she met locals in Chester alongside Queen Elizabeth for a series of events.  Sharon Briscoe, 61, who had traveled about 25 miles east from Chirk, Wales, for the chance to meet Meghan asked her how she was enjoying her new life.  “It is wonderful,” Meghan told her. “I’m really enjoying it.”  Briscoe adds, “I said to give our love to Harry and to look after him.”  Meghan then replied: “I will do. That means an awful lot to us. He’s the best husband ever.”  Meghan Markle Tim Rooke/REX/Shutterstock  She added that the new Duchess of Sussex “looked radiant” and Meghan said, “That’s so kind.”  “She seems so genuine and really warm and not rushing with people,” Briscoe said.  Meghan Markle Neil Mockford/GC Images  Also at Storyhouse — the second stop on Meghan’s outing with Queen Elizabeth on Thursday — the duo took a tour of the children’s library and met with a Syrian settlement group engaged in craft work. They also watched a performance by a dance theatre company for people in recovery from addiction, as well as a medley of songs from Storyhouse’s latest production, A Little Night Music. Local school children joined the actors for another performance.  Press Association via AP Images  Queen Elizabeth, 92, then unveiled a plaque to mark the official opening of Storyhouse, which serves as a live theater, library and movie theater in the city’s center.

            "text: Don’t get us wrong: There’s no truth to those rumors that Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton's relationship is rocky. The two, who are set to be sisters-in-law when Markle marries Prince Harry in May, are certainly amicable. But there’s a difference between being friendly and being inseparable.  “I think they are certainly friendly and they are spending more time with each other. You know they’re neighbors in Kensington Palace and I know that Meghan enjoys going over to see Kate and the children, and she does enjoy that. I’m told there’s always an open invitation for her to be with Kate ever when she wants,” royal expert and author of Harry: Life, Loss, and Love told InStyle. “I think that any animosity is probably a fabrication in the press. I’ve never heard to suggest that they don’t get along.”  CHRIS JACKSON/AFP/Getty Images  You’re right if you could hear the “but” coming, though.  “I do hear plenty to suggest that they’re quite different people and that have quite different interests and that Meghan is quite independent and very confident and very keen to I think establish her own network of friends over here in London,” Nicholl added.  “So that’s certainly not to say she’s snubbed Kate in any way. I think they do spend time together. But I think Meghan’s keen not to rely too much on Kate and to have her own friends as well.”  It seems that Markle certainly already has a group of good friends in London, as they were quick to throw her a lavish spa-themed bridal shower earlier in March. Middleton wasn’t present at the three-day event, but that doesn’t mean anything in terms of their relationship.  Chris Jackson/Chris Jackson/Getty Images  When the two stepped out for Markle’s first official event with Queen Elizabeth on March 12, the two exchanged very authentic-looking smiles outside of Westminster Abbey and even seemingly color-coordinated their looks.  PAUL GROVER/AFP/Getty Images  We have no doubt that they will continue to get closer over time—especially if Meghan and Harry start a family of their own. The prince said in a November interview with the BBC that they hope to start one \"in the near future.\"\n",

            "text: Kate Middleton and Prince William got married on April 29, 2011, and ever since that highly romantic/fated/legendary day, the Duchess has been wearing a pretty band made of Welsh gold on her ring finger. Look, here it is stacked next to her massive engagement bling:  Getty Images  Prince William, on the other hand, wears approximately NOTHING on his finger. Here he is meeting Paddington Bear, where you can see pretty clearly that he's not wearing a wedding band. And yes, maybe I took this as an opportunity to post a photo of Paddington Bear. No regrets.  Getty Images  So, now that we've established that William doesn't wear a ring, a couple of questions remain....  1. Did Kate Give Wills a Ring on Their Wedding Day?  Answer: Nope! Here's a video of their ceremony, where you can plainly see William pop a ring on Kate, and she pop nothing on him in return:  And here's a GIF in case your boss frowns on you watching ancient royal wedding videos at work:  Getty Images  2. Do Most Royal Men Wear Wedding Rings?  It depends, but mostly yes! Prince Charles wore a wedding band stacked behind his pinkie signet ring when he married Princess Diana:  Getty Images  And nowadays he wears a similar one as a symbol of his marriage to Camilla:  Getty Images  Meanwhile, Prince William's brother Prince Harry has been wearing a wedding ring since his marriage to Meghan Markle:  Getty Images  That said, Prince Philip (Queen Elizabeth's husband) doesn't wear a ring—so it's not like William is fully alone on a ring-less island.  3. So, Why Did William Opt Out?  The reason comes down to personal preference. Royal biographer Penny Junor told Vogue, \"He doesn’t like jewelry, and the Palace issued a statement before their wedding saying so.\"  This is true, though it was less of a \"statement\" and more of an anonymous tip from a palace aide to veteran royal reporter Rebecca English. \"It was something the couple discussed but Prince William isn't one for jewelry—he doesn't even wear a signet ring—and decided he didn't want to,\" the aide confirmed. \"It really is just down to personal preference.\"  The aide also claimed that Kate was completely fine with William's decision, adding, \"It is quite common for men in that strata of society not to wear a traditional wedding band. If they do, they tend to wear it with their family signet ring but William doesn't have one of those.\"  Welp, there you have it. Kay, bye-bye as you were!\n",

Princess Beatrice and Karlie Kloss Karlie Kloss/Instagram  Beatrice’s Instagram might be a secret, but it’s not exactly breaking royal protocol. Royals with formal working roles, like Prince Harry, Prince William, Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle, are not allowed to have their own social media accounts (they use the official palace accounts), but for those who have jobs outside the family, it’s permitted.

That's the rumor floating around social media today thanks to a new report from Life & Style magazine.  The tabloid claims that Kate is pregnant with twins, and sonograms have revealed that she's expecting two girls.  A source says Will and Kate “couldn’t be happier about their double-baby news\" and have already begun picking out names.  “She’s been telling pals that she’s thrilled to be pregnant with two little princesses and has been proudly showing the sonogram to those closest to her.”  Yes, insiders claim a pair of princesses will be entering the world in 2018.  But don't expect any of that cutesy name nonsense:  “They don’t plan to coordinate the girls’ names to rhyme or start with the same letter,\" says the source.  \"Though they’re still debating the final choices, they’ve narrowed down names for the second baby, the source said: “They both like Victoria, Alice, Olivia, Alexandra, and Elizabeth.”  “One of the babies was calm and relaxed, whereas the other had endless energy,” the source adds.  “In a way, Kate feels like she got an idea of what the girls’ personalities are like! Kate jokes that the active baby is a ‘drama queen in the making.’”  The insider claims that the twins have already begun to express their different personalities:  “Kate says the chill baby is taking after George, and her sister is like Charlotte, personality-wise,” the source continued.  “But both babies have been keeping Kate awake at night, as they’re constantly hiccupping and moving around!”  We don't know why Will and Kate are bothering with all these traditional names when obviously they should dub the twins Chill Child and Princess Anxiety.  Jeez, it's like we have to think of everything for these royals!  The source adds that the whole family has been helping out around the palace as Kate prepares to welcome the new arrivals, including Meghan Markle who will marry Prince Harry in May:  “Meghan [Markle] has been by Kate’s side during the pregnancy and is always helping out,” the source reveals.  “Meghan often cooks healthy meals for Kate to ensure she’s getting all the right nutrients. She adores George and Charlotte and looks after them if Kate wants to take a nap.”  Yes, if the source is reliable, a royal wedding and two royal babies are on the horizon.  If this were a reality show, we'd say they're overdoing it!\n",

BIGGEST NEWS OF THE WEEK  The excitement is in the air, as Meghan's family and friends are starting to make their way to London. Just in time for Mother's Day, Meghan's mom, Doria Ragland, arrived in England earlier this week.  A source told ET on Thursday that Meghan has \"normal last-minute nerves\" ahead of her nuptials, but is happy to have her mother by her side in the days before she says \"I do.\" According to our source, this is the first time Doria will see Meghan's dress, as Meghan just had her final fittings a week and a half ago. The Los Angeles native's father, Thomas Markle, is also expected to arrive by the weekend.  \"Doria will be here to help Meghan relax in the last days before she becomes a [royal],\" the source said, adding that one of Meghan's closest pals, Jessica Mulroney, will arrive next week to \"help Meghan out with last-minute touches ahead of her big day.\"  WEDDING COUNTDOWN  So, how many days until the royal wedding? Meghan and Harry will officially be tying the knot in:  Getty Images  ROYAL RUMOR ROUNDUP  The rumor mill this week has Queen Elizabeth sneaking a peek at Meghan's wedding dress. The bride's gown is said to be hidden away in Windsor and will show it to the queen this week or possibly the next, according to US Weekly.  Another story circulating the web is that Meghan's gown -- rumored to be a custom Ralph & Russo Couture creation -- will cost approximately $135,600.  \"Meghan’s dress is expected to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars,\" royal expert Melanie Bromley told Harper's Bazaar. \"It's going to be featured in the history books, so needs to stand the test of time.”  The price may seem quite high, though that doesn't compare to Kate Middleton's custom Alexander McQueen design that cost around $400,000. \"But that eye-watering price was befitting for a future queen, so it’s unlikely Meghan’s will be as expensive because it could be seen by some as being disrespectful,” Bromley added.  ET’s royal expert Katie Nicholl had echoed those sentiments back in March, saying, \"I think it's very unlikely that Meghan would spend more than that and in doing so try and upstage a future queen.\"  OUT AND ABOUT  Although we didn't get a real sighting from Meghan and Prince Harry this week (they're kinda busy, ya know, preparing for a royal wedding!), fans freaked out via social media when Madame Tussauds unveiled two wax figures of the bride-to-be on Wednesday.

Last weekend, they made their first public appearance but didn’t sit together. Then, this week, they turned it up a notch and not only sat together in public but also held hands.  Yet, this weekend, the lovebirds really threw it all on the table. Not only did Prince Harry reportedly leave his seat to join Markle and her mom in their box, Harry was actually spotted planting a kiss on her cheek.  Of course this gesture is still delicate enough to be part of the Royal Courtship Plan. But those watching closely predict that Harry could be bending the knee very soon.

            "text: Royal entrances, the exchanging of vows and an emotional tear. These are the best moments from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding. (Published Friday, June 15, 2018)  Just a few hours before the royal wedding, Buckingham Palace announced that Queen Elizabeth II had bestowed three titles on her grandson, Prince Harry. His bride, Meghan Markle, will be known as Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Sussex after today's ceremony.  \"The Queen has today been pleased to confer a Dukedom on Prince Henry of Wales. His titles will be Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel,\" a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said. \"Prince Harry thus becomes His Royal Highness The Duke of Sussex, and Ms. Meghan Markle on marriage will become Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex.\"  See All the Best Moments From the Royal Wedding  The previous Duke of Sussex was married twice, but neither marriage was approved by his father. As such, they were considered unlawful. And so, Meghan is the first Duchess of Sussex.  It is customary for members of the Royal Family to be offered at least one title by the monarch upon marriage. The titles, ranked from highest to lowest are: duke, marquess, earl, viscount, and baron for men; and duchess, marchioness, countess, viscountess, and baroness for women.  Stars at the Royal Wedding  Royal Wedding A-Z: Everything You Need to Know  If the 33-year-old prince had turned down the title, he would've remained HRH Prince Harry of Wales. His 36-year-old bride would have likely been known as HRH Princess Harry of Wales, rather than HRH Princess Meghan, since the former actress is not a princess in her own right.  The Duke of Sussex was widley seen as the most likely choice for Harry, but other possibilities were the dukedoms of Albany, Clarence, Connaught, Cumberland and Teviotdale, and Windsor.  Prince William and Kate Middleton received their titles before their 2011 wedding. \"The Queen has today been pleased to confer a Dukedom on Prince William of Wales. His titles will be Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn and Baron Carrickfergus,\" Buckingham Palace said at the time. \"Prince William thus becomes His Royal Highness The Duke of Cambridge and Miss Catherine Middleton on marriage will become Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge.\"  © Copyright E!

            "text: Meghan Markle misses her day job!  The Duchess of Sussex, who starred as Rachel Zane for seven seasons on USA's Suits, told an Irish well-wisher that she misses acting.  Fiona Moore, a fan, recalled her conversation with Meghan -- who was wearing a suit that was reminiscent of her fictional counterpart -- following the Duchess' walkabout with her husband, Prince Harry, in Dublin, Ireland, on Wednesday.  \"I'm a fan of Suits and I said to her that I miss it and she said, 'So do I',\" Moore told Hello!  Moore added of Meghan's disposition, \"She seemed very relaxed and was joking and laughing.\"  Getty Images  When Meghan's character walked down the aisle to marry Mike Ross -- played by Patrick J. Adams, who also recently departed the show -- in the season finale, the fictional couple left a bit of a hole in the world of Suits. With Katherine Heigl joining the cast for its eighth season -- which premieres next week -- and Dulé Hill and Amanda Schull being bumped to series regulars, creator Aaron Korsch is hopeful about the show's future.  \"I’m going to miss Meghan and Patrick, but I think there are still interesting stories to tell,\" Korsch tells The New York Times in a piece published earlier this week. \"And then on the other side of it, you have a rejuvenation with new energy, on screen and off.”  On Thursday, the 36-year-old actress had a shot at earning an Emmy nomination for her last-ever acting role. Last month, a rep for USA confirmed to ET that Meghan was submitted for Emmy consideration in the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series category -- but ultimately didn't make the cut.  Meghan and Prince Harry, 33, have had a jammed pack itinerary the last couple of days.

            "text: Kate Middleton wasn't always a royal — but she did some from a wealthy family. Eddie Mulholland - Pool/Getty Images  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn't always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton's net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here's everything we know about Middleton's net worth:  What is Kate Middleton's net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of two — who is expecting her third royal baby by the end of April— is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton's wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn't have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton's net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William's net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William's wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  What do we know about Kate Middleton's money?  Most of Middleton's net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew's. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton's net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Chris Jackson/Getty Images  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn't need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family's royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million— as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.\n",

            "text: It feels like the royal wedding was just yesterday, but people are already placing bets on when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will welcome a royal baby. Markle's father, Thomas Markle, only added to the speculation when he appeared on the U.K.'s Good Morning Britain this week and said \"I don't think there is a stork in the air yet but I think it will happen sooner or later.\"    In so many ways, Meghan Markle's life as a Duchess is different from what most newlywed women experience, but in this way, it's pretty similar. While other women don't have millions of eyes watching them the way Markle does, constantly being asked if you're pregnant or trying to conceive can make a woman feel like she does.  Actress Gabrielle Union has previously stated that this isn't just a problem for women in the spotlight, like her and Markle, but for many women. \"People feel very entitled to know, 'Do you want kids?'\" Union said while promoting her book, We're Going to Need More Wine. \"A lot of people, especially people that have fertility issues, just say 'no' because that's a lot easier than being honest about whatever is actually going on. People mean so well, but they have no idea the harm or frustration it can cause.\"  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle did go on record as being team kids during their first post-interview engagement with the BBC. When asked the kid question, Prince Harry replied, \"I think eventually, one step at a time and we'll start a family in the near future.\"  That doesn't mean that it's happening right this moment.  If Meghan Markle and Prince Harry ever announce that a royal baby is on the way, we will be so happy for them, but until that day comes, we'd be happy if everyone but the couple kept the stork talk to themselves.  Planning a pregnancy is a personal, often private decision...even if you are the one of the most famous women in the world.  You might also like:\n",

            "text: CLOSE Among her many unforgettable qualities, Diana was known for her fabulous style. From ditching her gloves to speaking to the people through her clothing, Diana's flawless style lives on. USA TODAY  Princess Diana and her mother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II in London, August 4, 1987. (Photo: Associated Press)  Princess Diana mystified and irked the British royals in life, but in death she changed them in ways that strengthened the monarchy by making them seem a bit more like her — warm, approachable, human.  Exhibit A has to be the 2012 London Olympics when Queen Elizabeth II, then 86 and celebrating 60 years on her throne, participated in an extraordinary video skit to open the Games, featuring James Bond actor Daniel Craig and \"the queen\" as a Bond girl skydiving from a helicopter into Olympic Stadium. Mouths dropped, especially those of her grandchildren, as tens of thousands of Brits watching cheered and roared.  RELATED: Princess Diana remembered  \"Would she have done that cameo had it not been for Diana, all those years earlier, who emboldened them to do things in a fresh way and be more relatable?\" says American biographer Sally Bedell Smith, who's written best-sellers about both the queen and Diana.  The Princess of Wales' feelings about the Windsors were as mercurial as she was, toggling between awe and admiration to rage and despair during the years she was the desperately unhappy wife of Prince Charles and the daughter-in-law of the queen and Prince Philip.  As the queen herself said at the time, there were \"lessons to be drawn\" from the story of Diana, and these are now apparent, says British PR consultant and royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams.  \"Diana's more approachable, endearing and emotional style, her conviction that the royal family had no heart, the way she appealed to the public in (interviews), all this was unique but had real impact,\" Fitzwilliams says. \"It is a tribute to the resilience of the Windsors that they have made certain changes yet kept the monarchy's mystique.\"  Despite her troubles with her in-laws, Diana said she wanted to bolster the ties between the monarchy and the people; she was, after all, the mother of a future king.  \"It's vital the monarchy keeps in touch with the people — it's what I try to do,\" she told former Times editor Peter Stothard at a lunch in 1994, according to Phil Dampier's new collection of Diana quotes, Diana: I'm Going to Be Me.  British royal reporter and broadcaster Katie Nicholl, author of several royal biographies, says Diana broke the royal mold: She did and said things considered \"very un-royal\" that had a positive effect, especially in the way her sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, were raised to be aware of life beyond palace walls.  \"As they have said in recent interviews they are the princes and the men they are today largely because of the way Diana raised them and the things that she exposed them to from an early age,\" Nicholl says.  Queen Elizabeth and other members of Britain's royal family bow their heads as Princess Diana's casket moves slowly past the gates of Buckingham Palace in London, Sept. 6, 1997. (Photo: Associated Press/BBC TV)  \"There is a rawness in these interviews, an openness that Diana would have approved,\" says Fitzwilliams. \"The princes are following directly in her footsteps.\"  Diana campaigned for \"politically sensitive\" causes not previously connected to the royals, including AIDS, homelessness and landmines — issues that touched real people and people who had no voice, Nicholl says.  \"Ultimately, this was all very positive for the royal family even though the queen and others were concerned at points that some of the issues Diana was campaigning for weren’t synonymous with what royals should be doing,\" Nicholl says. \"To the people, Diana was seen as in touch. She was a princess, but one who wasn’t afraid to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in and that did the royal family a huge amount of good.\"  No doubt the 1,000-year-old British monarchy already knew a thing or two about keeping in touch with the people (to do otherwise risked execution and exile over the centuries), but it was Diana — equal parts beguiling and bewildering — whose shocking death helped remind them of this fundamental survival skill.  After she was killed in a Paris car crash in 1997, an almost-as-shocking tsunami of grief washed over Britain and the world, and nearly swamped the royals.  Tucked away at their usual summer bastion of Balmoral, their vast estate in Scotland, they were unprepared for the unprecedented reaction back in London: The hysteria, the headlines, the 24/7 media coverage. Also, the persistent importuning, from then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and many others, that the queen return, respond to the public grief, and put on a semi-royal funeral for Diana.  \"The queen has an unchanging style which has been perfection; the death of Diana was the one occasion where reliance on tradition and precedent were not appropriate and Blair was fortunately there to advise her,\" Fitzwilliams says.  The queen met all the demands and more, after first balking. She rose to the occasion with a stirring live speech to the nation (a rarity) before the funeral in which she paid tribute to Diana.  Queen Elizabeth II speaks from Buckingham Palace to pay tribute to Princess Diana, on Sept. 5, 1997. (Photo: AP)  In deed and metaphor, the queen bowed her head to Diana's coffin, and it was sincere. Diana was no longer a member of the royal family, and she had behaved in obnoxious ways in the years before her 1996 divorce, but she was still the mother of the queen's young grandsons; this was a gesture no loving grandmother would withhold.  \"Diana had a real effect on the monarchy,\" Smith says. \"They realized, in their practical and efficient way, that Diana had touched people in a special way, in accessibility and informality. They commissioned research, polling, focus groups, and they responded, not in a dramatic way, but in an incremental way. The queen did things a little more informally, she loosened protocol.\"  Immediately, public opinion about the queen and her family swung back to its previous high levels. In the years since Diana's death, the royals have been more popular than ever, culminating in extravagant displays of affection for the queen during her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 and for her 90th birthday in 2016.  Even Prince Charles and his second wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, the longtime mistress Diana blamed for her marital woes, are popular (if only because they are not as widely despised as they were in 1997).

(Photo: DAVID BRAUCHLI, Associated Press)  Victoria Arbiter, daughter of the queen's former press secretary and a royal commentator for CNN in New York, says \"little glimpses of Diana\" are everywhere apparent today. But she also gives credit to the queen.  \"You can't take anything away from the queen and her ability to adapt and evolve and meet the needs of the people at any one time,\" Arbiter says. \"Diana should be credited with many changes, one of which is the royal family is very much more hands on. They're getting much more involved on a visceral level as a result of Diana.\"  Society's expectations have changed, Arbiter says. The deference and formality associated with the royals are disappearing. You might not see the queen sipping tea in a Starbucks, but she's no longer quite as remote as she once was.  \"It's been slow, gradual change,\" Arbiter says, \"and Diana was definitely the trigger.\"      .

            "text: As her wedding to Prince Harry gets closer, bride-to-be Meghan Markle has just been given an official aide—aka a right-hand woman to help with her all things royal.  An announcement was made earlier today that a former Kensington Palace press officer, Amy Pickerill, was chosen to assist Meghan Markle, and will handle any correspondences that she receives. Additionally, she will now be an assistant private secretary in Prince Harry’s office. A spokesman from Kensington Palace said the assistant \"will be working on Meghan Markle's programme.\"  As the royal wedding gets closer and closer, an assistant seems like the only natural next step as for Markle—the Suits star's has more royal duties than ever, and has already done four public engagements with Prince Harry.  Pickerill has been photographed with Markle a few times already—once during the couple's recent royal trip to Edinburgh, Scotland earlier this month, and was also seen holding a bouquet of tulips for the bride that had been given to her by a fan.  Details were released earlier this month about the upcoming nuptials , who announced their engagement in November 2017. The wedding will take place on Saturday, May 19 at 12 p.m. at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace previously announced, \"Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan Markle are hugely grateful for the many good wishes they have received since announcing their engagement.

            "text: Home video released by a childhood friend shows an 8-year-old Meghan Markle playing a queen in a backyard production of “Your Royal Highness” at a birthday party in 1990. The actress will be an official member of a real royal family when she weds Britain’s Prince Harry on May 19th. (Published Monday, March 26, 2018)  Twenty-eight years ago, Meghan Markle was queen for a day.  And in less than two months, she will marry Prince Harry and receive a royal title of her own. Long before she took one of the world's most eligible bachelors off the market, an 8-year-old Markle crowned herself and reigned over BFF Ninaki Priddy's birthday party. Priddy's private home video shows the future (and now retired) actress starring in an unscripted backyard production of \"Your Royal Highness,\" featuring Markle as the Queen and her pals as princesses.  \"We did a lot of playing 'make-pretend' as kids,\" Priddy told NBC. \"It was a lot of fun. Meg loved to be in that world of make believe. And she would always be the lead. Being an only child, there was definitely always this thirst of attention.  When the video was filmed in 1990, no one knew Markle would one day marry a member of the royal family. And yet, in hindsight, it gives a glimpse of the woman she was destined to be.  \"Your highness, isn't there anything to do around the kingdom anymore?\" one girl asks.  \"Yes!\" Markle replies. \"Make 900,000 cookies and sew me a nice dress.\"  \"Your highness, what is this all for?\" another girl asks.  Markle replies, \"It's for this meeting I'm having. I'm having people from Florida and Canada, Mississippi, Missouri.\" A benevolent ruler, Markle gives \"Princess Nikki\" and \"Princess Kara\" a 10-minute break and tells them to go inside.  A Look Back at Meghan Markle's Pre-Royal Life  In the living room, Markle says, \"Princess Kara, I thought I said no eating cookies in bed.\"  \"It's not a cookie, mother,\" her friend replies. \"It's a Chips Ahoy! chocolate chip cookie.\"  \"Oh! Carry on then,\" Markle says, feigning a British accent. \"Carry on.\"  Later on, Markle changes out of her red and white striped T-shirt and into a black and pink cocktail dress with polka dots and ruffles. At one point, the cameraman asks, \"Meghan, are you bored?\" She confesses that \"yes,\" she is a bit wearied. Before long, a clown arrives to entertain her--and he happily makes her a pink balloon animal.  At one point in the home movie, Markle wears a gold crown. Whether she'll get to wear one of Queen Elizabeth II's tiaras for her May 19 nuptials remains to be seen. Kate Middleton borrowed a Cartier halo tiara, which King George VI first purchased in 1936, when she married Prince William.  © Copyright E! Online\n",

            "text: Forget Wills and Kate's dusty old Norfolk. The lovebirds want to hang out with the groovy set in the Cotswolds - and the local estate agents' eyes are lighting up.  There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore.  And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down.  So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting.  £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains  Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month  Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills.  A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm.  'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals.  'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.'  £2million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There’s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it’s set at the end of a no-through road.  Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes.  Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area.  'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.'  However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood.  It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'.  £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier  A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home.  'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary.  'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.'  Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying £2 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings.  But sources say rather than living off his father's generosity, Harry wants to invest in a place of his own.  £4.25million - Cross Hill House, Adderbury, Oxfordshire: This 10-bedroom house, surrounded by landscaped gardens, is eight miles from Soho Farmhouse. There are ample stables in the grounds as well as a reassuringly private Victorian walled garden. The centrepiece of the house is a huge open-plan sitting and dining room  He has friends and relatives dotted across the Cotswolds, an area estate agents dub the 'Royal Triangle'.  Cousin Zara, her rugby-player husband Mike Tindall and their daughter Mia, three, live six miles from Highgrove in a cottage at Gatcombe Park, Princess Anne's country estate.  The Beckham brood, of whom the Prince is very fond, have been renovating a £5 million plot on the 4,000-acre Great Tew Estate in Chipping Norton since 2015.  Palace insiders say it's this tight-knit circle of friends that has prompted the couple to focus their search on the Cotswolds rather than Norfolk, where William and Kate rule the roost at Anmer Hall, a grand Georgian pile boasting a swimming pool and tennis court.  'They don't want to be second-runners to Kate and William,' one source says.  Locals have spotted the Prince — without his girlfriend — discreetly checking out several Cotswolds hotspots in recent months.  The blacked-out Range Rovers driven by royal protection officers have been spotted navigating the country lanes around Cirencester and Stow-on-the-Wold, while Harry has apparently been sipping pints of bitter in low-key village pubs.  £7.75million - Luckington Court, Chippenham, Wiltshire: This 11th-century house with original Tudor features is set in 157 acres of woodland and pasture, surrounded by a secure fence. There are eight bedrooms, four reception rooms, two kitchens, a music room, study and plenty of space for staff — a must for any royal retreat  'I'm not surprised he's moving here — he's in the local quite often,' says one resident. 'You'd see his security men sitting outside and you'd know he'd be in there.'  Of course, there are practical reasons for moving to the Cotswolds. Harry's royal duties require him to be close to London and Toronto-based Meghan, whose time on the U.S. TV series Suits is coming to an end, wouldn't cope well with being cut off from the metropolis.  'Harry is conscious that Norfolk would be too far out for someone with media leanings and an urban upbringing like Meghan,' a source close to the couple explains.  The couple have tested the water with two mini-breaks, in February and July, at Soho Farmhouse, the private members' club-cum-hotel in Great Tew, which has become a haven for stars who want to go under the radar.  Regulars include George and Amal Clooney, while Harry's cousins Beatrice and Eugenie were recently spotted sipping mojitos by the pool.  Luxury cabins at the farmhouse — owned by the West London club Soho House, whose consultant Markus Anderson introduced Harry and Meghan last July — cost up to £725 a night, but members say it's more likely the pair took the main farmhouse for £6,000 a night.  Meghan is said to adore the £110 brightening facials and £120 evening primrose body wraps at the on-site Cowshed spa.  £3.95million - Amberley Court, Stroud, Gloucestershire: This 17th century manor boasts eight bedrooms, six receptions, a tennis court, infinity pool, stables and a two-bedroom guest lodge. It also has 22-cares of grounds. It's eight miles from Highgrove and two miles from Gatcombe Park, and within striking distance of Beaufort Polo Club, where Harry attends charity days  Proximity to the Farmhouse, as well as Daylesford Organic, a chi-chi farm shop and bakery 15 miles away, are said to be top of Meghan's requirements for a new home.  Second on her list is plenty of outside space for her two rescue dogs, Bogart and Guy.  Harry is also said to be looking for somewhere spacious, but not big or showy, so he can keep horses and turn the land into a polo field.  'That's always been his dream,' a royal source explains.  Other must-haves are a decent kitchen — Harry is a keen chef — a helipad and a space to host parties out of reach of neighbours, passing traffic and long lenses.  The royal budget should be more than enough to secure a place that meets these requirements. Harry has a fortune in excess of £30 million. Meghan is worth around £4 million from film and TV work.  But more pressing than price is how they go about finding their dream home. Royals don't peer in estate agents' windows; well-connected chums will have been asked to do research for them.  'Harry is being discreet,' a friend says. 'This is a word-of-mouth search, with Harry's friends pulling out all the stops.'  £3.95million - Amberley Court, Stroud, Gloucestershire: This 17th century manor boasts eight bedrooms, six receptions, a tennis court, infinity pool (pictured), stables and a two-bedroom guest lodge. It also has 22-cares of grounds. It's eight miles from Highgrove and two miles from Gatcombe Park, and within striking distance of Beaufort Polo Club, where Harry attends charity days  Palace sources say VanHan, a property company founded by royal confidants Thomas van Straubenzee and Rory Penn, has been given the nod to lead the hunt.  The Mayfair firm markets some of the capital's finest properties — recently including the £39 million Bulgari Hotel penthouse — to wealthy clients.  VanHan also has access to a small roster of exclusive country piles. Viewings are strictly private and the properties are labelled 'off market' to deter prying eyes.  Sources say Harry's inner circle — Tom Inskip, whose Jamaican wedding he and Meghan attended in March; Eton pal Jake Warren; filmmaker Arthur Landon and Viscount Julian Erleigh — will be alerting contacts behind the scenes, while cousin Zara, is on hand for local advice.  Of course, there is still the tricky question of timing. Traditionally, royal couples haven't lived together until after marriage, but Kate and William set a precedent in Anglesey, spending time in their North Wales home before their wedding in 2011.  Insiders say protocol dictates Harry and Meghan should at least be engaged before moving in.  So is the house-hunt a sign that a proposal is on the cards? This week, U.S. magazines claimed the couple are already engaged, after Harry popped the question in Botswana in August.  Sources close to the couple say this may not be far from the truth, with the pair starting seriously discussing marriage — a step some are calling an 'unofficial' engagement.  But the timing of an announcement would be tricky, with so many royal anniversaries taking place, not least the Queen and Philip's 70th wedding anniversary in November.  However long they have to wait, locals are thrilled by the prospect of their new neighbours.  'The last thing we want is the world and his wife trying to get into Soho Farmhouse,' one Chipping Norton resident confides. 'You get a bit fed up of the actresses swanning around. But a prince — now, that's a real celebrity.'\n",

Markle said his daughter was only concerned about his health in a tearful phone call with Prince Harry when he shared that he would be unable to attend her wedding.  \"They were disappointed,\" he said. \"Meghan cried, I'm sure, and they both said, 'Take care of yourself, we are really worried about you.'\"  Meghan's father said he apologized to Meghan and Harry for his error in judgment with regard to taking the photos.  \"I realized it was a serious mistake,\" he said. \"It's hard to take it back.\"  Kensington Palace issued a statement on Meghan’s behalf shortly before the wedding and after her father announced he would be undergoing heart surgery.  \"Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding,\" Markle, 36, said in the statement from Kensington Palace. \"I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.  \"I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support,\" the statement continued. \"Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\"  First conversation with Meghan about her new boyfriend  The first phone calls were, \"Daddy, I have a new boyfriend.' And I said, 'That's really nice,' and the next phone call was like, 'He's British,' and I said, 'That's really nice,' and eventually the third time around was like: 'He's a prince.'\"  He continued: \"And at that point, she said, 'It's Harry,' and I said, 'Oh, Harry, OK!' She said, 'Of course we’ll have to call him 'H' so no one knows we're talking about Harry.'\"  WORLD EXCLUSIVE: ‘Daddy, I have a new boyfriend’ - Thomas Markle talks about his daughter’s romance with Prince Harry #GMB pic.twitter.com/rzASEpEsKf — Good Morning Britain (@GMB) June 18, 2018  \"We talked a little about how they met and how happy they were with each other,\" Markle reflected.  \"He's quite easy to talk to; he's quite a comfortable person to talk to,\" Markle added. \"I wasn't nervous. Ten thousand miles apart, it's hard to be nervous talking to someone on the phone.\"  Asking for Meghan's hand in marriage  Thomas Markle recounted the moment when Prince Harry asked him for his daughter's hand in marriage over the phone.  \"You are a gentleman, promise me you will never raise your hand against my daughter and of course I will grant you my permission,'\" he recalled saying.  Markle said his daughter has \"been a princess since the day she was born,\" adding, \"He made a good pick, didn't he?\"  When asked about Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, Markle replied, \"I’ve had respect for that women since I was a child. I think she’s one of the most incredible women in the world and I would love to meet her.\"  On Meghan wanting children  Thomas Markle also revealed that Meghan and Harry are ready to start a family.  \"She's wanted children for a long time,\" the former Hollywood producer told \"Good Morning Britain.\" \"When she met Harry and spoke about how much she loved him, there’s got to be a child in the making somewhat soon.\"  WORLD EXCLUSIVE: ’She [Meghan] has wanted children for a long time' - Thomas Markle #GMB pic.twitter.com/XYg7O4P8gW — Good Morning Britain (@GMB) June 18, 2018  On when he knew the relationship was serious  The wide-ranging interview with \"Good Morning Britain\" saw hosts Piers Morgan and Susannah Reid ask about when he realized that Meghan and Harry's relationship was serious.  \"I can't give you a date, no, [but] it was certainly a few months before the announcement of the engagement,\" he said.  \"My daughter is very intelligent. She knows how to choose who she wants to be with. She's a smart girl and she made a good pick. The royals are very complicated, but she can always rise to that occasion.  \"My daughter is capable of anything and she will be a complement to the royal family.\"  Danny Lawson/AP  On the staged photos and paparazzi deal  For the first time Meghan's father discussed the leaked photographs and his agreement to participate in order to change his image.  \"For the last year photographs of me were always derogatory,\" he explained. \"They would take pictures of my hand grabbing the beer, they’d take pictures of me getting in my car, taking the garbage out, they’d take pictures of me buying a toilet and making a big deal out of it. They took all kinds of pictures making me look negative.\"  He said he apologized to his daughter and son-in-law over the phone.  \"I thought this would be a nice way of me improving my look. Well obviously that all went to hell. And I feel bad about it,\" he said. \"I apologized for it and that’s all I can do. I can't do much beyond that. That was a mistake.

            "text: After the birth of Prince George and Princess Charlotte, Prince William and Kate Middleton have stirred the rumours to swing between having and not having the third baby. While the family has not cleared the air about Kate's third pregnancy, a new report suggests that there could be possibilities that the couple might not have baby number 3 and Meghan Markle is to be blamed for it.  According to a claim made by Celeb Dirty Laundry, Kate is not planning to get pregnant with her third child because she fears there will be a competition for media attention between her and Meghan once she gets married to Prince Harry. And Kate is not up for such kind of spirit.  Also Read: Prince George turns 4: Adorable photos of the Royal that perfectly capture his priceless expressions  The site wrote that since Harry and Markle are hoping to have kids some day, the \"entire world will be on Meghan Markle bump watch to see how fast she'll end up getting pregnant\" after the wedding. And Middleton doesn't want to \"compete\" with Markle for \"media attention\".  Adding to the statement, the website shared there's \"no doubt\" Middleton \"loves all the attention she gets whenever she's pregnant,\" but she is going to leave it to Markle to \"get pregnant next.\"  While the story was published on their website recently, it was not accompanied by any particular quote from the royal family. This led to Gossip Cop to reach out to find out if there was any truth in the made claim. As it turns out, CDL's claims were false.  The Gossip Cop insider debunked the claim terming the said story is \"nonsense.\" Adding to which, the website shared that the royal couple has not ruled out the prospects of having their third child.  There have been speculations that Kate Middleton and Prince William are thinking about having a third baby. The couple has joked about their plans several times and they clearly love watching the world go berserk with every hint they drop.  The recent opportunity that the couple nabbed to discuss baby number 3 was at their royal trip to Germany and Poland. Kate was gifted a stuffed bear that mimicked the sound babies hear when they are in the womb. Designed by a tech start-up in Warsaw, the gift was presented to the mother-of-two at an event in Poland. The gift immediately saw Kate turn towards Prince William and joked: \"We will just have to have more babies.\"  Do you think the royal couple should plan for the third baby?

            "text: The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom. The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3]  Announcement of engagement [ edit ]  Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the \"wave of abuse and harassment\" directed toward Markle.[5]  Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8]  The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8]  During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11]  Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17]  Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20]  Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at the Queen's Sandringham estate.[28] The official engagement photographs were taken by Alexi Lubomirski (a former assistant to Mario Testino) at Frogmore House, and were issued by Kensington Palace on 21 December 2017.[29]  To mark the wedding of Harry and Meghan, the Royal Mint produced an official UK £5 coin, showing the couple in profile.[30] In May, a set of commemorative postage stamps, featuring the couple's official engagement photographs, was issued by Royal Mail.[31]  Wedding [ edit ]  Planning [ edit ]  Preparation for wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle  Unlike the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the wedding day of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was not declared a bank holiday.[32] The wedding was on the same date as the FA Cup Final, which Prince Harry's brother William normally attends in his role as President of the Football Association.[33] Holding the royal wedding on a weekend is a break with the royal tradition of having weddings on a weekday.[34] On 12 February 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the ceremony would commence at 12:00 Midday BST.  Venue [ edit ]  The wedding took place on Saturday, 19 May 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor.[35] The chapel had previously been the venue for the weddings of Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as that of his cousin, Peter Phillips, and for the blessing of the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Harry's stepmother.[36]  Cost [ edit ]  The royal family announced that they would pay for the wedding.[37] The costs for the cake, the florist, and the catering have been estimated to be £50,000, £110,000, and £286,000 respectively,[38] and the overall cost is expected to be around £32 million.[39] The security costs are expected to be lower than those of the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.[40] The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead has reportedly spent £2.6 million on cleaning the town and roads.[40] It has been predicted that the wedding will trigger a tourism boom and boost the economy by up to £500 million.[41]  Wedding attire [ edit ]  The wedding invitations specified a dress code for men of \"Dress Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit\"; for women, \"Day Dress and Hat\".[42]  Bride and bridesmaids [ edit ]  The wedding dress was designed by the British designer Clare Waight Keller under the aegis of the fashion house Givenchy.[43] It was made of \"double-bonded silk cady cushioned by an underskirt in triple silk organza\" and had a boat neckline, long sleeves and sweeping train.[44][45] The silk veil was 16 feet (4.9 m) long and was embroidered with 55 flowers, representing the 53 countries of the Commonwealth,[44][46] as well as Wintersweet, which grows in front of Nottingham Cottage, where she and Harry live, and the California Poppy, the state flower of California.[47] It was secured by a diamond bandeau tiara, made in 1932 for Queen Mary and lent to Markle by Queen Elizabeth II.[44][48] The centre brooch had been a wedding gift from the County of Lincoln in 1893. The tiara is a platinum band, made up of eleven sections, a detachable centre brooch with interlaced opals and diamonds.[49] The shoes were also from Givenchy, and had a pointed couture design.[44]  Other ensembles worn by the bride included white gold and diamond earrings and bracelet made by Cartier.[44][48][50] Markle's hair was rolled up with \"face-framing fringe tucked behind her ears\",[51] and was done by Serge Normant.[52] Make-up artist Daniel Martin did Markle's makeup for the occasion.[51][53] The look was described as \"a soft brown eyeshadow\" with minimal makeup on the face.[51] Her nails were painted in a \"neutral pink-y beige\" for the ceremony.[54] The bride's bouquet, designed by Philippa Craddock, contained \"forget-me-nots, scented sweet peas, lily of the valley, astilbe, jasmine and astrantia, and sprigs of myrtle\".[44] The flowers were chosen by the groom who handpicked forget-me-nots in honour of his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales.[44][55] After the wedding the bridal bouquet was placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey, following royal tradition that began with the Queen Mother.[56] For the customary bridal themes of \"Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue\", Markle had her gown and veil (the \"new\"), the Queen's tiara (the \"borrowed\"), sprigs of myrtle taken from \"a plant grown from the myrtle used in the Queen's wedding bouquet\" and a piece of fabric from Diana, Princess of Wales's wedding gown (the \"old\"), and Diana's favourite flowers, forget-me-nots, in the bouquet (the \"blue\").[57][58] The young bridesmaids also wore high-waisted silk dresses designed by Clare Waight Keller which had puff sleeves.[59]  Groom, best man and page boys [ edit ]  Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge wore the frock coat uniform of the Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons) in which both were commissioned,[note 3] and Prince Harry served for 10 years, including in combat in Afghanistan.[60] The uniforms were made by Dege & Skinner, gentleman's tailors and uniform makers, of Savile Row, London.[61][62] The groom asked for and received the Queen's permission to keep his beard, as beards are only permitted under exceptional circumstances in the British Army.[60] Prince Harry wore the rank of major with the star of the Royal Victorian Order, of which he is a Knight Commander, along with the ribbons of the Royal Victorian Order, Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan, Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, and Army Air Corps wings.[63] Prince William, also with the rank of major, had EIIR cyphers on his shoulder straps and gold aiguillettes on his right shoulder (indicating his position as an aide-de-camp to the Queen), and wore the star of the Order of the Garter, the ribbons of the two jubilee medals, and his RAF wings.[61][64] The pageboys wore uniforms by Dege & Skinner that resembled the uniform of the Blues and Royals worn by the groom and best man. Each page boy had his initials on the shoulders in place of rank badges.[61]  Wedding party [ edit ]  On 26 April 2018, Kensington Palace announced that Prince Harry had selected his older brother, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, as his best man.[65][66] There was initially no confirmation as to whether Prince William would miss the FA Cup Final, which he would normally attend in his role as President of The Football Association, or if he would be able to attend both the wedding and the football. A statement from Kensington Palace that the timing of the wedding would not clash with the match was released in December 2017.[67] However, it was confirmed in March that the Duke would not be attending the final that day.[68]  There were suggestions that the bride's friend Jessica Mulroney would be her maid of honour.[69][70] In early May 2018, there was confirmation that there would be no maid of honour, and that the bridesmaids and page boys would all be children.[71] A total of ten bridesmaids and page boys were chosen, with the bride and groom each selecting five: two of Markle's godchildren, seven-year old Rylan Ritt and her six-year-old sister Remi, as well as Brian, John and Ivy Mulroney, the three children of her friend Jessica Mulroney, were chosen by the bride, while Prince Harry's nephew and niece, Prince George and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, as well as his godchildren Florence van Cutsem, Zalie Warren and Jasper Dyer, were selected by the groom.[72][73]  On 18 May 2018, Kensington Palace announced Prince Charles would accompany Markle down the aisle, after she confirmed her father, Thomas Markle Sr., would not be attending the wedding due to his recent heart surgery.[74][75] The bride spent the night before the wedding at Cliveden House along with her mother, while the groom stayed at Coworth Park Hotel with his brother.[76][77] Markle made her way to the church accompanied by her mother.[78]  Approximately 250 members of the British Armed Forces were involved in the wedding, the majority coming from units that have a connection with Prince Harry:[79]  Wedding service [ edit ]  The wedding service was conducted according to the Christian liturgy for Holy Matrimony as set out in Common Worship of the Church of England, mother Church of the Anglican Communion.[3]  From 8.00 am, the public started to arrive at the grounds of Windsor Castle. The main congregation and the guests[82] all started to arrive at the chapel at 9.30 am, followed by members of the Royal Family. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were the last members of the Royal Family to depart for the ceremony, as is tradition, arriving at the chapel at 11.52 am.[83] Shortly after, Markle arrived with the party of junior attendants. She proceeded down the aisle followed by the attendants, where the Prince of Wales met her to escort her through the quire of the chapel. He accompanied her to the altar, where Prince Harry was standing.[84][85]  Prince Harry's maternal aunt, Baroness Fellowes, read a scripture lesson from The Song of Solomon in the Christian Bible. The Dean of Windsor, David Conner, conducted the service with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, performing the marriage ceremony. The sermon was delivered by The Most Reverend Michael Curry, presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church (the American member church of the Anglican Communion).[86][87] Curry's 14-minute address, which quoted Martin Luther King Jr., emphasised the redemptive property of love;[88][89] its unexpected length caused the service to overrun by eight minutes.[90] Chaplain to the Queen The Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin and Coptic Orthodox Archbishop of London Anba Angaelos offered the prayers.[91]  The marriage vows were those published in Common Worship, and included the promise to \"to love and to cherish\" each other.[92] This was sealed by the exchange of rings.[92] The wedding rings were created by Cleave and Company, with Markle's ring being fashioned out of Welsh gold and the Prince's ring made of platinum.[93] After the signing of the registers, Harry and Markle together with the guests sang the national anthem. The couple paused briefly to bow and curtsey to the Queen before walking down the aisle.[94] They were followed in procession by other members of the bridal party, and their families.[92] The couple shared a kiss on the steps outside the chapel.[95]  Music [ edit ]  Hymns sung at the wedding included Lord of All Hopefulness and Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer.[96] Prince Harry was seen wiping away a tear during the congregational singing of the latter, which was a favourite of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and was sung at her funeral in 1997;[97] it was also the opening hymn to William's wedding in 2011.  Two choirs, an orchestra, the chapel organ and fanfare trumpeters provided music for the service. The orchestra was made up of musicians from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the English Chamber Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra. In addition to the Choir of St George's Chapel, the Kingdom Choir, a gospel group led by Karen Gibson, sang \"Stand By Me\" in what was described as \"an incredible and powerful moment\".[98] The State Trumpeters of the Household Cavalry, who played a fanfare, included Kate Sandford, the first female state trumpeter at a British royal wedding.[99] The music was under the overall direction of James Vivian, the chapel's Organist and Director of Music; and the orchestra was conducted by Christopher Warren-Green.[100][101]  The bride walked down the aisle to \"Eternal source of light divine\" (from the Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne) by Handel, sung by soprano Elin Manahan Thomas, with the trumpet obbligato performed by David Blackadder.[102] Other music during the service included the motet \"If Ye Love Me\" by Thomas Tallis; the song \"Stand by Me\" by Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller and Ben E. King, arranged for choir by Mark Delisser; and \"The Lord bless you and keep you\" by John Rutter. During the signing of the register, 19-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason and the orchestra played Sicilienne attributed to Maria Theresia von Paradis, Fauré's Après un rêve, and an arrangement for cello and orchestra of Schubert's Ave Maria. For the procession, the musicians performed the Allegro from the Symphony No. 1 in B-flat major by William Boyce and \"This Little Light of Mine\" by Etta James, Jester Hairston and Harry Dixon Loes.[103]  Family celebrations [ edit ]  St George's Hall, Windsor Castle Frogmore House  Following the ceremony, there was a carriage procession through Windsor. Two receptions were held; the first, for those attending the ceremony, was hosted by the Queen and took place in St George's Hall after the carriage procession. Singer Elton John performed for the guests and the groom and the Prince of Wales each gave a speech.[60] A second reception at Frogmore House, for family and close friends and hosted by the Prince of Wales, occurred later in the day.[86] Harry drove his new wife to the reception at Frogmore in a silver blue Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero, with left-hand drive. For the evening reception, the Duchess of Sussex wore a halter-neck, open back dress by Stella McCartney and an emerald cut Aquamarine ring formerly belonging to Diana, Princess of Wales.[104][105] George Northwood was her hairstylist for the private party.[105] In a break with tradition, the bride made a speech at the event.[60] The Duke of Cambridge also gave a best man's speech. DJ Idris Elba and The Atlantic Soul Orchestra performed at the event.[106][107][108] The event ended with small fireworks displayed above Frogmore House.[109]  The wedding cake was a layered lemon and elderflower cake and decorated with peonies in shades of white and cream.[110] The cake designer Claire Ptak, based in London, was chosen in March 2018.[111]  Three official wedding photos were released. They were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski at Windsor Castle following the ceremony.[112]  Guests [ edit ]  In April 2018, it was announced that an \"official list\" of domestic and international political leaders was not required for the wedding and that Prime Minister Theresa May, Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn, and other leaders would not attend the ceremony. President of the United States Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama were also not invited.[113] This was in contrast to the wedding of Prince Harry's elder brother, which had a large number of such guests due to his position as a future monarch.[114] The decision not to invite political leaders to the wedding was taken in part because of the limitations of the venue, and also took into account Prince Harry's position as sixth in line to the throne.[114] The only politician invited was the former Prime Minister Sir John Major as he previously was \"a special guardian on legal matters to Princes William and Harry after the death of their mother\".[60]  With a smaller ceremony and reception at St George's Hall, the guest list included approximately 600 people, most of whom have a \"direct relationship\" with the couple.[115] Also, 200 close friends of the couple were invited to attend the evening reception at Frogmore House.[116] Approximately 1,200 members of the public were invited to greet the couple outside the chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle.[115] The invitees outside the chapel were \"people from charities, Windsor Castle community members, people from the royal households and the Crown Estate, and local school children\".[117]  Sarah, Duchess of York, the former wife of Prince Andrew, was invited to the wedding even though she had not been invited to the weddings of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011, Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly in 2008, or Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall in 2011. However, she was not invited to the evening reception at Frogmore House hosted by Prince Charles and was reportedly \"deeply upset\" by her omission.[118]  Amongst the non-royal guests were Markle's Suits co-stars Patrick J. Adams (with wife Troian Bellisario), Gabriel Macht (with wife Jacinda Barrett), Sarah Rafferty, Rick Hoffman, Gina Torres and Abigail Spencer, actors George Clooney (with wife Amal Clooney), Idris Elba and Tom Hardy, actresses Oprah Winfrey, Priyanka Chopra and Carey Mulligan (with husband Marcus Mumford), television host James Corden, tennis player Serena Williams (with husband Alexis Ohanian), David and Victoria Beckham, musicians Sir Elton John (with husband David Furnish), James Blunt, Joss Stone, and rugby players Jonny Wilkinson and James Haskell. Megan's close friend, stylist Jessica Mulroney (with husband Ben Mulroney) and Harry's ex-girlfriends Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy were also in attendance. Other guests were members of the Middleton family.[119][120][121][122][123]  The only foreign royal guests at the wedding were Prince Harry's friend Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, with whom he co-founded, after the death of both of their mothers, the Sentebale foundation to help AIDS-stricken orphans in Lesotho, and his wife Princess Mabereng.[124]  Gifts for guests [ edit ]  The 2,640 members of the public invited to Windsor Castle for the wedding were gifted gift bags to commemorate the event. The bag had the initials of the couple, date and venue location printed on the exterior. Inside was an order of service booklet for the wedding, a gold chocolate coin, a bottle of water, a fridge magnet, a 20% off voucher for the Windsor Castle gift shop and a tube of handbag shortbread.[125]  Charitable donations [ edit ]  In April 2018, the couple requested that, rather than sending wedding gifts, people should make a donation to one of seven charitable organisations, none of which they had a formal association with:[126][127]  CHIVA (Children's HIV Association): The small charity supports more than 1,000 young people living with HIV in the UK and Ireland.  Crisis: The national homeless body works with thousands of people a year to help rebuild their lives.  The Myna Mahila Foundation: The organisation, based in Mumbai, helps empower women through offering stable employment and breaking cultural taboos around menstrual hygiene. Myna Mahila also teaches women life skills such as maths, English and self-defence.  Scotty's Little Soldiers: The charity supports children who have lost a parent while serving in the British Armed Forces.  StreetGames: The organisation uses sport to help young people and communities become healthier and safer.  Surfers Against Sewage: The national marine conservation body works to protect oceans, beaches, waves and wildlife.  The Wilderness Foundation UK: Vulnerable teenagers from urban communities are taught about the great outdoors and rural employment opportunities.

            "text: Meghan Markle: Six reasons why she divides people — even Americans  Updated  If you thought every American would be celebrating the prospect of a Yankee taking up residence in the Royal household, you'd be mistaken.  As Prince Harry and Meghan prepared to wed, there had been an astounding level of venom aimed at both of them, on both sides of the Atlantic.  Far from being the happy, feathery event that certainly Kensington Palace and television networks hoped for, the wedding has unpacked layers of discontent among the Queen's subjects and her former subjects alike.  As Tom Wells of The Sun put it on Twitter: \"This has to be the worst build-up to a Royal wedding since Henry VIII last went down on one knee.\"  The anti-Meghan outcry has caused no level of surprise and consternation at news outlets and websites that follow the Royals, and even those that marginally mention the Royal couple.  While they value the traffic the pair have brought in, digital editors have discovered they can't leave their comments sections unchecked, or else the nastiness takes hold.  \"The most surprising thing about covering Meghan's fashion isn't the fashion at all,\" says Susan Kelley, who created What Kate Wore, the popular site tracking the Duchess of Cambridge's style, and also oversees What Meghan Wore, which features attire and activities.  \"It's been the level of animosity directed at her and the number of comments on the site and on Facebook that couldn't be published because of the tone or language.\"  Even a food writer friend who posted an innocuous \"where to watch the nuptials\" post this week was blindsided by attacks on Meghan.  She is already the most controversial British Royal bride since Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, who many people will never embrace because she succeeded Diana, Princess of Wales.  Meghan readily brings to mind the uproar over Wallis Simpson, the twice-divorced American for whom Edward VIII gave up the throne.  In retrospect, those women had it much, much easier than Meghan. In watching the Royal drama for the better part of 18 months, I've come up with a list of six objections to her marriage, led by the big one they never had to address.  1. She's bi-racial  The first, and unmistakable overtone in every conversation about her is racism. Meghan is bi-racial, and identifies herself as such. Her mother Doria is African-American. Her father Thomas is white.  This is far from unusual in public life. President Barack Obama was bi-racial, with a white mother and black father, although he identified as black.  Academy Award winning actress Halle Berry is bi-racial. Canadian rapper Drake is bi-racial. So is football star Colin Kaepernick.  Although intermarriage was outlawed in many parts of the US during the first two-thirds of the 20th century, Americans who grew up in the 1970s and after are likely to know mixed-race couples, and socialise and go to school with bi-racial kids.  For a lot of people, especially in major urban and college cities, Meghan's background would only bring on a shrug.  But, there is an old American saying that one drop of blood makes you black, and, in some of the most bigoted commenters' eyes, makes you unfit to be a princess of the United Kingdom.  Says Kelley: \"I never expected to see the sort of negative, derogatory and outright racist comments we have encountered in writing about Meghan's style.\"  This is even true when What Kate Wore runs a photo of the Duchess and Meghan at the same event, Kelley says.  Kensington Palace tried to attack this head on when Harry and Meghan were first dating in 2016. In an unprecedented statement, the Palace said: \"His girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment. Some of this has been very public — the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments.\"  Said the Palace: \"This is not a game — it is her life, and his.\"  That did little to stop the racist comments, and now Harry and Meghan face a future in which this is a day to day part of their lives.  If you think it will die down, just look at any internet post that is at all flattering to Camilla. The Diana fans are out in constant force.  2. She's divorced  But racism isn't the only thing that Meghan deals with.  The second most-frequently heard objection is that she is divorced, while Harry has never married.  The critics are conveniently forgetting that Princes Charles and Andrew are also divorced, as is Princess Anne. American first marriages still fail at a rate of 40 per cent to 50 per cent, although the British divorce rate has been dropping.  3. Unbelievably, her fashion  Commenters also have taken Meghan apart for her hairstyle, and fashionably loose-fitting clothing. It doesn't help that she's far more fashion forward than Kate, whose pristine public style often seems to have been voted on by a committee.  4. She 'dumped' her rescue dog  Fourth is an objection from animal lovers, who bemoan the fact that she left one of her aged rescue dogs behind when she moved to London from Toronto.  5. She's American  I'm putting her American nationality at fifth, although you might argue that it should rank higher. Lots of us thought that the Royal wedding might cement and repair the \"special relationship\" between the US and Britain — our best for their best.  But that theory seems as much in tatters as the current political climate. Apparently, Harry was supposed to pick a red, white and blue bride echoing the British flag, not ours.  I've seen Facebook comments from my own American friends asking, \"Why isn't Harry marrying a British girl?\"  There is plenty of sniping as well from British ex-pats who predict the marriage won't make it past five years, and accuse Meghan of being a gold digger.  6. She's a TV actress  That final critique applies to Meghan's choice of an acting career. To be honest, I've never watched Suits, save for a glimpse at an episode or two to see what she did on the show.  In an era when quality television programs have swept over the networks, cable television and streaming services, Suits remains a guilty pleasure for its viewers and a skippable one for the rest of us.  Meghan might be a talented actress, with university degrees in drama and international affairs, but she's never been showcased in the kind of TV that scoops up Emmy Awards and BAFTAs.  Would it make people feel better if Harry was instead marrying one of the better young actresses of our time, such as Emma Stone, Saoirse Ronan or Margot Robbie? Possibly.  It hasn't gone unremarked that Meghan seems all too willing to ditch her acting career for activism. She won't be like Princess Grace, who fended off many efforts to entice her back to film. For Meghan, been there, done that, now on to charity work.  But a slightly better professional resume might have quieted some of the haters. If you take all the complaints together, it adds up to one angry beehive. Says Kelley:  \"The volume of comments that couldn't be published on the blogs or that had to be deleted on the respective Facebook pages is far beyond anything I anticipated.\"  All these reasons might not matter a whit historically. Thanks to the birth of Kate and Williams' children, Harry is way down in the line of succession, so there's only a miniscule chance of a King Harry and Queen Meghan.  Thus far, the pair have managed to smile their way through every crisis that takes place, including whether Meghan's father, sadly in poor health, will walk her down the aisle.  But Meghan has married her prince at a time when the world is divided about almost everything, including her.  Unwittingly, that makes her the perfect Royal bride for our times.

There's also another royal baby on the way for Kate Middleton and Prince William, along with a royal wedding to look forward to in 2018. Below, a look back at some of the more exciting moments from Buckingham Palace, Kensington Palace, and beyond.  1. When Kate, Will, and Harry raced each other to promote mental health (February 5)  As part of their Heads Together organization, Their Royal Highnesses hit the running track at Olympic Park with folks training for the 2017 London Marathon. While Kate was the only one properly dressed for the race, she finished last.  2. When Kate and Will looked like a million bucks at the 70th EE British Academy Film Awards (February 12)  Getty  Kate’s off-the-shoulder gown, complete with a gorgeous bouquet print, was made possible by one of her favorite fashion houses, Alexander McQueen. Prince William looked pretty great in his tux, too.  3. When Queen Elizabeth met an elephant (April 10)  Getty  Yes, that’s the Queen feeding a banana to Donna the elephant. The Duke of Edinburgh was also on hand to help open the new Centre for Elephant Care at Whipsnade Zoo, the UK's biggest zoo, in Bedfordshire, England.  4. When Kate was photographed curtsying to Queen Elizabeth on Easter Sunday (April 16)  Getty  As per royal etiquette, one should curtsy upon seeing the Queen for the first time on any given day. This meeting generally takes place behind closed doors, so royal enthusiasts welcomed this photograph, which also showed William bowing, with open arms.  5. When William and Lady Gaga FaceTimed to talk about mental health (April 18)  The Duke of Cambridge and @LadyGaga join forces to encourage more people to speak openly about their mental health #OKtosay pic.twitter.com/kCuQyS3Svn — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) April 18, 2017  As part of Kate, William, and Harry’s latest #oktosay series with their Heads Together campaign, William and Lady Gaga opened up about their personal struggles in a four-minute video call, which was shared on the singer and the Prince’s social media platforms. “For me, the little bits that I’ve learnt so far is that it’s really important to have this conversation. You won’t be judged,” William said in the clip.  6. When Kate, William, and Harry cheered on runners at the 2017 London Marathon (April 22)  Imagine getting a (foam) high five from the Duchess of Cambridge while clocking in another mile!

When Canadian Governor General David Johnston broke royal protocol and touched Queen Elizabeth’s arm (July 19)  Getty  During a Canada 150 celebration in London, Johnston found himself in the middle of a teeny tiny scandal when he was spotted grazing the royal elbow of Queen Elizabeth II as they made their way down some carpeted steps. As he later explained to CBC News, “I’m certainly conscious of the protocol. I was just anxious to be sure there was no stumbling on the steps… It’s a little bit awkward, that descent from Canada House to Trafalgar Square, and there was carpet that was a little slippy, so I thought perhaps it was appropriate to breach protocol just to be sure there was no stumble.”  12.

When Kensington Palace released a new photo of Prince George ahead of his fourth birthday (July 21)  Chris Jackson/Getty Images  16. When Prince Philip made his final solo appearance at an official event (August 2)  Back in May, Philip announced his retirement after completing more than 22,000 solo appearances over 70 years ever since becoming a member of the British royal family. For his final solo appearance, the 96-year-old bowed out with a tribute from the Royal Marines on a rainy day at Buckingham Palace.  17.

We’re two people who are really happy and in love.”  21.

Paddington Bear was also there to represent the cast of the upcoming Paddington 2 movie and somehow convinced the Duchess to show off a few dance moves on the platform.  22. When Prince Harry and Michelle Obama surprised a group of students in Chicago (October 31)  The 20 lucky students got the meeting of a lifetime at Hyde Park Academy, which sits across the future site of the Obama Presidential Center on the South Side of Chicago.

When Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip celebrated 70 years of marriage (Nov. 20)  Ahead of the big day, new photographs of the Queen and His Royal Highness were released on the official Royal Family Facebook page and other social media platforms.

Prince Harry (33) and Markle (36) will be tying the knot on May 19, 2018 at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle, England.

Due to her elegant style and refined taste, we believe that Meghan Markle is a Justin Alexander bride.

Since Meghan Markle is marrying into the Royal family, she will likely wear something a bit more conservative with touches that embody her unique and captivating sense of style. This Justin Alexander high neck tonal beaded and embroidered lace fit and flare wedding dress is subtly sexy. The floral and heraldry motifs layered over silk tulle and silk charmeuse provide a refined elegance that is appropriate yet untraditional.

Although British weddings don't traditionally have maids of honor (instead, there's a \"chief bridesmaid\"), Kate broke custom to have her sibling by her side on her big day.    Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  So who will be Meghan Markle's Pippa on May 19? No one, actually.  Markle will not have a maid of honor at the wedding, since she could not pick one from her close group of friends. (This contradicts reports from January, which said the bride-to-be had already chosen a maid of honor.) This marks a rare The bridesmaids and page boys will all be children (including Prince George and Princess Charlotte), following British royal wedding tradition.  Though they won't be in the bridal party, Meghan's friends have still been supporting her in preparing for the royal wedding on May 19. Below are all the women we thought were in the running for the maid of honor role.  Kate Middleton  Getty Images  The Duchess of Cambridge has been giving Markle helpful advice, on everything from getting adjusted to the royal family to personal style. Despite their budding friendship, it was expected early on that Meghan would choose \"one of her closest friends who has stood by her for many years before meeting Harry,\" as a maid of honor.  Markle and Middleton only met in January 2017, The Sun reports. And though fans are excited to tout the pair as BFFs, they still have a lot of bonding to go. Royal expert Katie Nicholl told InStyle that Meghan is independent and interested in creating her own friend group in London, but not with any disrespect to Kate at all.  Plus, on a technical level, Kate \"is the future queen consort when William becomes king after his father, and would unlikely be an attending person to another royal bride,\" royal expert Marlene Koenig revealed. Middleton wasn't even a maid of honor at her own sister's wedding, so it's not a surprise she isn't one at Meghan's.  Jessica Mulroney  Getty Images  Meghan met her best friend and stylist, Jessica Mulroney, in 2011, around the time Markle moved to Toronto (Mulroney's home base) to film Suits, according to The Sun. Since then they've bonded over yoga sessions and joint vacations.

Priyanka Chopra  The Quantico actress and the Suits star first met at the ELLE Women in Television dinner in 2016. \"We bonded as actors,\" she told People of their friendship. \"We just became friends, like two girls would.\"  Since Meghan and Harry's relationship went public, Chopra has urged people to consider Markle as more than just the prince's girlfriend. She called Vanity Fair's profile of the actress \"just a little sexist\" because it mainly focused on Markle's relationship with Harry, and she shut down Wendy Williams when she described Markle as \"Prince Harry's girlfriend.\"  When Harper's BAZAAR Arabia asked her if she's going to be a bridesmaid at the royal wedding, Chopra teased, \"If you see me there, you’ll know.\"  Serena Williams  Getty Images  The star athlete first met Markle in 2014, at DIRECTV's Celebrity Beach Bowl, E! News reports. Meghan recalled in her former lifestyle site, The Tig, \"We hit it off immediately, taking pictures, laughing through the flag football game we were both playing in, and chatting not about tennis or acting, but about all the good old fashioned girly stuff. So began our friendship.\"  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  In the following years, Markle supported Williams through her matches at competitions like the U.S. Open and Wimbledon (where she actually sat a few rows away from Pippa Middleton). Williams even contributed to a few blog posts to The Tig, according to E!.  \"She quickly became a confidante I would text when I was traveling, the friend I would rally around for her tennis matches, and the down to earth chick I was able to grab lunch with just a couple weeks ago in Toronto,\" E! says Markle wrote on The Tig, describing her friendship with Williams.  \"We are both the same age, have a penchant for hot sauces, and adore fashion, but what connects us more than those things is perhaps our belief in exceeding expectations–our endless ambition,\" she added.  Though Meghan unfortunately wasn't present at Williams' nuptials to Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian in November 2017, there's still a chance the newlywed tennis champ could show up at Windsor Castle for Markle.

In August 2016, the bride-to-be posted an Instagram (which has now been deleted, like the rest of her social media accounts) dedicated to her costars, with the caption: \"Celebrating our friendship of six years and counting. So much deep love for these two women.\" The former actress also nicknamed Rafferty her \"Suits sister wife.\"  After Harry and Meghan's relationship was confirmed in November 2016, Rafferty gave a brief response in an interview with the AP. \"I don't comment on my castmates' personal lives, but of course, it's very exciting,\" she said. \"And I'm very happy for her.\"  In February 2017, tabloid site OK Magazine reported that Torres and her husband Laurence Fishburne (whom she divorced in November) had a double date with Markle and Harry.

The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3]  Announcement of engagement [ edit ]  Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the \"wave of abuse and harassment\" directed toward Markle.[5]  Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8]  The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8]  During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11]  Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17]  Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20]  Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at the Queen's Sandringham estate.[28] The official engagement photographs were taken by Alexi Lubomirski (a former assistant to Mario Testino) at Frogmore House, and were issued by Kensington Palace on 21 December 2017.[29]  To mark the wedding of Harry and Meghan, the Royal Mint produced an official UK £5 coin, showing the couple in profile.[30] In May, a set of commemorative postage stamps, featuring the couple's official engagement photographs, was issued by Royal Mail.[31]  Wedding [ edit ]  Planning [ edit ]  Preparation for wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle  Unlike the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the wedding day of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was not declared a bank holiday.[32] The wedding was on the same date as the FA Cup Final, which Prince Harry's brother William normally attends in his role as President of the Football Association.[33] Holding the royal wedding on a weekend is a break with the royal tradition of having weddings on a weekday.[34] On 12 February 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the ceremony would commence at 12:00 Midday BST.  Venue [ edit ]  The wedding took place on Saturday, 19 May 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor.[35] The chapel had previously been the venue for the weddings of Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as that of his cousin, Peter Phillips, and for the blessing of the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Harry's stepmother.[36]  Cost [ edit ]  The royal family announced that they would pay for the wedding.[37] The costs for the cake, the florist, and the catering had been estimated to be £50,000, £110,000, and £286,000 respectively,[38] and the overall cost was expected to be around £32 million.[39] The security costs were expected to be lower than those of the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.[40] By the end of May, it was estimated that the security costs were \"between £2 million and £4 million\". The police and crime commissioner could also apply for special funding if the costs were to exceed 1% of the Thames Valley Police force's annual budget, but at the time the cost was \"well below the £4 million required to make a claim\".[41] The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead reportedly spent £2.6 million on cleaning the town and roads.[40] It was predicted that the wedding would trigger a tourism boom and boost the economy by up to £500 million.[42]  Wedding attire [ edit ]  The wedding invitations specified a dress code for men of \"Dress Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit\"; for women, \"Day Dress and Hat\".[43]  Bride and bridesmaids [ edit ]  The wedding dress was designed by the British designer Clare Waight Keller under the aegis of the fashion house Givenchy.[44] It was made of \"double-bonded silk cady cushioned by an underskirt in triple silk organza\" and had a boat neckline, long sleeves and sweeping train.[45][46] The silk veil was 16 feet (4.9 m) long and was embroidered with 55 flowers, representing the 53 countries of the Commonwealth,[45][47] as well as Wintersweet, which grows in front of Nottingham Cottage, where she and Harry live, and the California Poppy, the state flower of California.[48] It was secured by a diamond bandeau tiara, made in 1932 for Queen Mary and lent to Markle by Queen Elizabeth II.[45][49] The centre brooch had been a wedding gift from the County of Lincoln in 1893. The tiara is a platinum band, made up of eleven sections, a detachable centre brooch with interlaced opals and diamonds.[50] The shoes were also from Givenchy, and had a pointed couture design.[45]  Other ensembles worn by the bride included white gold and diamond earrings and bracelet made by Cartier.[45][49][51] Markle's hair was rolled up with \"face-framing fringe tucked behind her ears\",[52] and was done by Serge Normant.[53] Make-up artist Daniel Martin did Markle's makeup for the occasion.[52][54] The look was described as \"a soft brown eyeshadow\" with minimal makeup on the face.[52] Her nails were painted in a \"neutral pink-y beige\" for the ceremony.[55] The bride's bouquet, designed by Philippa Craddock, contained \"forget-me-nots, scented sweet peas, lily of the valley, astilbe, jasmine and astrantia, and sprigs of myrtle\".[45] The flowers were chosen by the groom who handpicked forget-me-nots in honour of his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales.[45][56] After the wedding the bridal bouquet was placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey, following royal tradition that began with the Queen Mother.[57] For the customary bridal themes of \"Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue\", Markle had her gown and veil (the \"new\"), the Queen's tiara (the \"borrowed\"), sprigs of myrtle taken from \"a plant grown from the myrtle used in the Queen's wedding bouquet\" and a piece of fabric from Diana, Princess of Wales's wedding gown (the \"old\"), and finally a piece of fabric from the dress she wore on their first date stitched in the veil (the \"blue\").[58][59][60] The young bridesmaids also wore high-waisted silk dresses designed by Clare Waight Keller which had puff sleeves.[61]  Groom, best man and page boys [ edit ]  Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge wore the frock coat uniform of the Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons) in which both were commissioned,[note 3] and Prince Harry served for 10 years, including in combat in Afghanistan.[62] The uniforms were made by Dege & Skinner, gentleman's tailors and uniform makers, of Savile Row, London.[63][64] The groom asked for and received the Queen's permission to keep his beard, as beards are only permitted under exceptional circumstances in the British Army.[62] Prince Harry wore the rank of major with the star of the Royal Victorian Order, of which he is a Knight Commander, along with the ribbons of the Royal Victorian Order, Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan, Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, and Army Air Corps wings.[65] Prince William, also with the rank of major, had EIIR cyphers on his shoulder straps and gold aiguillettes on his right shoulder (indicating his position as an aide-de-camp to the Queen), and wore the star of the Order of the Garter, the ribbons of the two jubilee medals, and his RAF wings.[63][66] The pageboys wore uniforms by Dege & Skinner that resembled the uniform of the Blues and Royals worn by the groom and best man. Each page boy had his initials on the shoulders in place of rank badges.[63]  Wedding party [ edit ]  On 26 April 2018, Kensington Palace announced that Prince Harry had selected his older brother, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, as his best man.[67][68] There was initially no confirmation as to whether Prince William would miss the FA Cup Final, which he would normally attend in his role as President of The Football Association, or if he would be able to attend both the wedding and the football. A statement from Kensington Palace that the timing of the wedding would not clash with the match was released in December 2017.[69] However, it was confirmed in March that the Duke would not be attending the final that day.[70]  There were suggestions that the bride's friend Jessica Mulroney would be her maid of honour.[71][72] In early May 2018, there was confirmation that there would be no maid of honour, and that the bridesmaids and page boys would all be children.[73] A total of ten bridesmaids and page boys were chosen, with the bride and groom each selecting five: two of Markle's godchildren, seven-year old Rylan Ritt and her six-year-old sister Remi, as well as Brian, John and Ivy Mulroney, the three children of her friend Jessica Mulroney, were chosen by the bride, while Prince Harry's nephew and niece, Prince George and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, as well as his godchildren Florence van Cutsem, Zalie Warren and Jasper Dyer, were selected by the groom.[74][75]  On 18 May 2018, Kensington Palace announced Prince Charles would accompany Markle down the aisle, after she confirmed her father, Thomas Markle Sr., would not be attending the wedding due to his recent heart surgery.[76][77] The bride spent the night before the wedding at Cliveden House along with her mother, while the groom stayed at Coworth Park Hotel with his brother.[78][79] Markle made her way to the church accompanied by her mother.[80]  Approximately 250 members of the British Armed Forces were involved in the wedding, the majority coming from units that have a connection with Prince Harry:[81]  Wedding service [ edit ]  The wedding service was conducted according to the Christian liturgy for Holy Matrimony as set out in Common Worship of the Church of England, mother Church of the Anglican Communion.[3]  From 8.00 am, the public started to arrive at the grounds of Windsor Castle. The main congregation and the guests[84] all started to arrive at the chapel at 9.30 am, followed by members of the Royal Family. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were the last members of the Royal Family to depart for the ceremony, as is tradition, arriving at the chapel at 11.52 am.[85] Shortly after, Markle arrived with the party of junior attendants. She proceeded down the aisle followed by the attendants, where the Prince of Wales met her to escort her through the quire of the chapel. He accompanied her to the altar, where Prince Harry was standing.[86][87]  Prince Harry's maternal aunt, Baroness Fellowes, read a scripture lesson from The Song of Solomon in the Christian Bible. The Dean of Windsor, David Conner, conducted the service with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, performing the marriage ceremony. The sermon was delivered by The Most Reverend Michael Curry, presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church (the American member church of the Anglican Communion).[88][89] Curry's 14-minute address, which quoted Martin Luther King Jr., emphasised the redemptive property of love;[90][91] its unexpected length caused the service to overrun by eight minutes.[92] Chaplain to the Queen The Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin and Coptic Orthodox Archbishop of London Anba Angaelos offered the prayers.[93]  The marriage vows were those published in Common Worship, and included the promise to \"to love and to cherish\" each other.[94] This was sealed by the exchange of rings.[94] The wedding rings were created by Cleave and Company, with Markle's ring being fashioned out of Welsh gold and the Prince's ring made of platinum.[95] After the signing of the registers, Harry and Markle together with the guests sang the national anthem. The couple paused briefly to bow and curtsey to the Queen before walking down the aisle.[96] They were followed in procession by other members of the bridal party, and their families.[94] The couple shared a kiss on the steps outside the chapel.[97]  Music [ edit ]  Hymns sung at the wedding included Lord of All Hopefulness and Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer.[98] Prince Harry was seen wiping away a tear during the congregational singing of the latter, which was a favourite of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and was sung at her funeral in 1997;[99] it was also the opening hymn to William's wedding in 2011.  Two choirs, an orchestra, the chapel organ and fanfare trumpeters provided music for the service. The orchestra was made up of musicians from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the English Chamber Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra. In addition to the Choir of St George's Chapel, the Kingdom Choir, a gospel group led by Karen Gibson, sang \"Stand By Me\" in what was described as \"an incredible and powerful moment\".[100] The State Trumpeters of the Household Cavalry, who played a fanfare, included Kate Sandford, the first female state trumpeter at a British royal wedding.[101] The music was under the overall direction of James Vivian, the chapel's Organist and Director of Music; and the orchestra was conducted by Christopher Warren-Green.[102][103]  The bride walked down the aisle to \"Eternal source of light divine\" (from the Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne) by Handel, sung by soprano Elin Manahan Thomas, with the trumpet obbligato performed by David Blackadder.[104] Other music during the service included the motet \"If Ye Love Me\" by Thomas Tallis; the song \"Stand by Me\" by Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller and Ben E. King, arranged for choir by Mark Delisser; and \"The Lord bless you and keep you\" by John Rutter. During the signing of the register, 19-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason and the orchestra played Sicilienne attributed to Maria Theresia von Paradis, Fauré's Après un rêve, and an arrangement for cello and orchestra of Schubert's Ave Maria. For the procession, the musicians performed the Allegro from the Symphony No. 1 in B-flat major by William Boyce and \"This Little Light of Mine\" by Etta James, Jester Hairston and Harry Dixon Loes.[105]  Family celebrations [ edit ]  St George's Hall, Windsor Castle Frogmore House  Following the ceremony, there was a carriage procession through Windsor. Two receptions were held; the first, for those attending the ceremony, was hosted by the Queen and took place in St George's Hall after the carriage procession. Singer Elton John performed for the guests and the groom and the Prince of Wales each gave a speech.[62] A second reception at Frogmore House, for family and close friends and hosted by the Prince of Wales, occurred later in the day.[88] Harry drove his new wife to the reception at Frogmore in a silver blue Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero, with left-hand drive. For the evening reception, the Duchess of Sussex wore a halter-neck, open back dress by Stella McCartney and an emerald cut Aquamarine ring formerly belonging to Diana, Princess of Wales.[106][107] George Northwood was her hairstylist for the private party.[107] In a break with tradition, the bride made a speech at the event.[62] The Duke of Cambridge also gave a best man's speech. DJ Idris Elba and The Atlantic Soul Orchestra performed at the event.[108][109][110] The event ended with small fireworks displayed above Frogmore House.[111]  The wedding cake was a layered lemon and elderflower cake and decorated with peonies in shades of white and cream.[112] The cake designer Claire Ptak, based in London, was chosen in March 2018.[113]  Three official wedding photos were released. They were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski at Windsor Castle following the ceremony.[114]  Guests [ edit ]  In April 2018, it was announced that an \"official list\" of domestic and international political leaders was not required for the wedding and that Prime Minister Theresa May, Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn, and other leaders would not attend the ceremony. President of the United States Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama were also not invited.[115] This was in contrast to the wedding of Prince Harry's elder brother, which had a large number of such guests due to his position as a future monarch.[116] The decision not to invite political leaders to the wedding was taken in part because of the limitations of the venue, and also took into account Prince Harry's position as sixth in line to the throne.[116] The only politician invited was the former Prime Minister Sir John Major as he previously was \"a special guardian on legal matters to Princes William and Harry after the death of their mother\".[62]  With a smaller ceremony and reception at St George's Hall, the guest list included approximately 600 people, most of whom have a \"direct relationship\" with the couple.[117] Also, 200 close friends of the couple were invited to attend the evening reception at Frogmore House.[118] Approximately 1,200 members of the public were invited to greet the couple outside the chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle.[117] The invitees outside the chapel were \"people from charities, Windsor Castle community members, people from the royal households and the Crown Estate, and local school children\".[119]  Sarah, Duchess of York, the former wife of Prince Andrew, was invited to the wedding even though she had not been invited to the weddings of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011, Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly in 2008, or Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall in 2011. However, she was not invited to the evening reception at Frogmore House hosted by Prince Charles and was reportedly \"deeply upset\" by her omission.[120]  Amongst the non-royal guests were Markle's Suits co-stars Patrick J. Adams (with wife Troian Bellisario), Gabriel Macht (with wife Jacinda Barrett), Sarah Rafferty, Rick Hoffman, Gina Torres and Abigail Spencer, actors George Clooney (with wife Amal Clooney), Idris Elba and Tom Hardy, actresses Oprah Winfrey, Priyanka Chopra and Carey Mulligan (with husband Marcus Mumford), television host James Corden, tennis player Serena Williams (with husband Alexis Ohanian), David and Victoria Beckham, musicians Sir Elton John (with husband David Furnish), James Blunt, Joss Stone, and rugby players Jonny Wilkinson and James Haskell. Megan's close friend, stylist Jessica Mulroney (with husband Ben Mulroney) and Harry's ex-girlfriends Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy were also in attendance. Other guests were members of the Middleton family.[121][122][123][124][125]  The only foreign royal guests at the wedding were Prince Harry's friend Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, with whom he co-founded, after the death of both of their mothers, the Sentebale foundation to help AIDS-stricken orphans in Lesotho, and his wife Princess Mabereng.[126]  Gifts for guests [ edit ]  The 2,640 members of the public invited to Windsor Castle for the wedding were gifted gift bags to commemorate the event. The bag had the initials of the couple, date and venue location printed on the exterior. Inside was an order of service booklet for the wedding, a gold chocolate coin, a bottle of water, a fridge magnet, a 20% off voucher for the Windsor Castle gift shop and a tube of handbag shortbread.[127]  Charitable donations [ edit ]  In April 2018, the couple requested that, rather than sending wedding gifts, people should make a donation to one of seven charitable organisations, none of which they had a formal association with:[128][129]  CHIVA (Children's HIV Association): The small charity supports more than 1,000 young people living with HIV in the UK and Ireland.  Crisis: The national homeless body works with thousands of people a year to help rebuild their lives.  The Myna Mahila Foundation: The organisation, based in Mumbai, helps empower women through offering stable employment and breaking cultural taboos around menstrual hygiene. Myna Mahila also teaches women life skills such as maths, English and self-defence.  Scotty's Little Soldiers: The charity supports children who have lost a parent while serving in the British Armed Forces.  StreetGames: The organisation uses sport to help young people and communities become healthier and safer.  Surfers Against Sewage: The national marine conservation body works to protect oceans, beaches, waves and wildlife.  The Wilderness Foundation UK: Vulnerable teenagers from urban communities are taught about the great outdoors and rural employment opportunities.

ABC began its coverage at 5 a.m. EDT with a special edition of Good Morning America.[143] NBC aired the ceremony at 4:30 a.m. EDT with a special edition of The Today Show.[144] The pay subscription network HBO hosted a live broadcast titled \"The Royal Wedding Live with Cord and Tish!\" starting at 7:30 a.m. EDT.[145] The parody hosts were Cord Hosenbeck and Tish Cattigan, the alter egos of former Saturday Night Live actors Will Ferrell and Molly Shannon. BBC America provided a live simulcast of BBC One's coverage, albeit with limited commercial breaks.[146]  The wedding was also aired on the Republic of Ireland's national broadcaster RTÉ.[147]  Comments in a \"posh\" British accent by a self-claimed British expert on some media turned out to be by an American, Thomas Mace-Archer-Mills.[148]  Titles [ edit ]  Traditionally, royal princes have been awarded peerages prior to their marriages; this occurred with both of Prince Harry's uncles, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex, as well as his elder brother, the Duke of Cambridge.[149] Hours before the wedding, Prince Harry was granted the titles Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton, and Baron Kilkeel, and Markle assumed the style \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex\" upon marriage.[1]  Reactions [ edit ]  British reactions to a mixed-race American marrying into the British royal family ( Voice of America  The wedding was widely reported as being significant for its departure from tradition typically associated with the Royal Family and for its inclusion of African-American culture in the service.[150][151][152][153][154] It was described as a \"landmark for African Americans\", for Black British, black and mixed-race women, and for the Royal Family itself.[155][156][157][158] Other reports cited more limited impact, including that \"Markle being biracial as opposed to African American impeded black people embracing her as one of their own\".[159][160]  The wedding, particularly Markle's choice of dress, as well as the cake and flowers, influenced the choices of other British brides for their weddings.[161]  Honeymoon [ edit ]  The couple did not leave for their honeymoon the day after their marriage, and were both scheduled to carry out public engagements in the week after the wedding.[162] The location of the honeymoon has been kept secret, although the press speculated that they might be headed to locations such as Namibia, Rwanda, and Botswana.[163][164][165]  See also [ edit ]\n",

Ready to throw a royal wedding viewing party? Click HERE for the ultimate guide.  Prince Charles will walk Markle down the aisle  Prince Charles will walk Markle from the quire, the area of St. George’s Chapel where the clergy and choir sit, to Harry. The procession in the nave, the central part of the church, will include Markle, the Dean of Windsor and Markle’s bridesmaids and page boys.  Markle originally asked her dad, Thomas Markle Sr., to walk her down the aisle but chose her soon-to-be father-in-law after her father became unable to attend the wedding.  Markle, 36, confirmed in a statement that her dad, who lives in Mexico, will not attend the wedding due to health concerns.  Who's who in the wedding party  Markle will not have a maid of honor by her side, as she did not want to single out one of her close circle of friends, sources told ABC News.  She will though have bridesmaids and page boys, all children, by her side at her wedding.  William and Kate's children -- Prince George and Princess Charlotte -- will take center stage at the wedding as a page boy and bridesmaid, respectively.  Karwai Tang/WireImage via Getty Images  Also joining Charlotte and George in the wedding party will be the three children of Markle's best friend, entrepreneur and style adviser Jessica Mulroney.  Ivy Mulroney, 4, will serve as a bridesmaid, while her older brothers, 7-year-old twins Brian and John Mulroney, will join George as page boys.  Also serving as a page boy will be Jasper Dyer, the 6-year-old son of Harry's mentor and close friend, Capt. Mark Dyer.  Joining Charlotte and Ivy as bridesmaids will be two of Harry's goddaughters -- 3-year-old Florence van Cutsem and 2-year-old Zalie Warren -- and two of Markle's goddaughters, 7-year-old Rylan Litt and her 6-year-old sister, Remi Litt.  William will serve as best man on May 19, just as Harry served as best man at William and Kate's wedding in 2011.  George Pimentel/WireImage/Getty Images  Who will design Markle's dress?  A top contender for designing Markle's gown is the design duo behind Ralph & Russo.  Australian-born designers Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo drew the spotlight when Markle chose their jaw-dropping $75,000 gown for her engagement photos with Harry last December.  Other possibilities for the coveted design assignment have included Christopher Bailey, the visionary behind the iconic British brand Burberry, British designer Stella McCartney, Canadian designer Erdem Moralioglu, and Roland Mouret, a close friend of Markle's.  George Pimentel/WireImage/Getty Images  British designer Victoria Beckham, whose sweater Markle wore in her engagement photos with Harry, has denied she is creating Markle's dress.  \"Sadly not, but I'm sure she will look incredible in whatever she wears,\" Beckham said on the April 12th episode of CBS' \"The Late Late Show With James Corden.\"  Markle had her first fitting with the unnamed designer in January at Kensington Palace, royal reporter Omid Scobie told ABC News at the time.  Markle's mom's important role  Markle’s mom, Doria Ragland, is expected to be the only member of her family attending the wedding. She will accompany Markle by car from her overnight location to Windsor Castle on the day of the wedding.  Samir Hussein/WireImage/Getty Images  Ragland, a Los Angeles-based yoga instructor and social worker, has spent the days before the wedding meeting Harry’s royal relatives and Harry and Markle’s closest friends in the U.K.  POOL/Paul GroverPAUL GROVER/AFP/Getty Images  Princess Diana's sentimental influence  Princess Diana's memory will be kept alive at the wedding through the presence of her three siblings.  Lady Jane Fellowes, Diana's sister, will deliver the reading at the wedding.  Both Markle and Harry have said how important it is that Harry's late mother be included in their wedding.  Anwar Hussein/Getty Images  \"I think she would be over the moon, jumping up and down, so excited for me,\" Harry said when his engagement to Markle was announced. \"But then, as I said, [she] would've probably been best friends with Meghan.\"  Markle's engagement ring features two diamonds from Diana's personal collection.  \"The little diamonds on either side are from my mother's jewelry collection to make sure that she's with us on this crazy journey together,\" Harry said in November.  Location, location, location  Harry and Markle will wed at St. George’s Chapel on the grounds of Windsor Castle, about 22 miles outside of London.  St. George's Chapel is a smaller venue than Westminster Abbey, where Prince William and Kate tied the knot in 2011, and St. Paul's Cathedral, where Prince Charles and Diana wed in 1981.  Dominic Lipinski/AFP/Getty Images  The chapel, which can seat 800 people, is where Harry was baptized in 1984. It is also where Harry's father, Prince Charles, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, held a service of prayer and dedication at the chapel in 2005 following their marriage at Guild Hall.  The last royal wedding to be held at St. George's Chapel was a decade ago, when Peter Phillips wed Autumn Kelly in May 2008, according to the chapel's website.  Where Harry and Markle will stay  The couple will stay at separate hotels on the eve of their wedding.  Harry will be joined by his best man, William, at the Dorchester Collection's Coworth Park. Markle and her mother will stay at Cliveden House Hotel, on the National Trust's Cliveden Estate, according to Kensington Palace.  Wedding day lineup  The wedding will begin at noon local time, 7 a.m., ET, on May 19.  The Right Rev. David Conner, the dean of Windsor, will conduct the wedding service. The Most Rev. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, who baptized and confirmed Markle, will officiate when the couple takes their marriage vows.  The Most Reverend Michael Bruce Curry, the 27th Presiding Bishop and Primate of The Episcopal Church, will give the address at the wedding.

Markle will also enter the chapel through the west steps, joined by some of the bridesmaids and page boys.  Following the hour-long wedding ceremony, the couple will meet in the chapel's Horseshoe Cloisterwith with 200 representatives of charities for which Harry has served as patron.  Harry and Markle plan to undertake a carriage procession that will start at St. George's Chapel, leave Windsor Castle via Castle Hill, continue along High Street through Windsor Town before returning to Windsor Castle on a route called the Long Walk.  Steve Parsons/PA Wire/PA Images  They will be waved off on their carriage ride by members of the Royal Family. The guests at the wedding service will observe the sendoff of the carriage procession.  After the carriage procession, the newlyweds will attend a lunchtime reception, hosted by Queen Elizabeth, at St. George's Hall, where they will rejoin their wedding guests.  In the evening, a smaller group of 200 guests will attend a reception hosted by Harry’s father, Prince Charles, at Frogmore House.  Frogmore House, also on the grounds of Windsor Castle, is the location Markle and Harry chose for their intimate engagement photos released by Kensington Palace in December.  Both receptions will be closed to the public but there may be a second glimpse of Markle and Harry when they depart Windsor Castle for Frogmore House in the evening.  The wedding cake's California connection  Harry and Markle selected pastry chef Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, East London, to design their wedding cake.  Ptak, like Markle, was raised in California before moving to London. Her bakery is notable for using seasonal and organic ingredients in cakes.  Ptak is creating a lemon elderflower cake with buttercream icing and fresh flowers as decorations, according to Kensington Palace.  ?? 200 Amalfi lemons  ?? 500 organic eggs from Suffolk  ?? 20kgs of butter  ?? 20kgs of flour  ?? 20kgs of sugar  ?? 10 bottles of Sandringham Elderflower Cordial The baking of the #RoyalWedding cake is under way! pic.twitter.com/b3jhwtOwOP — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 18, 2018  The choice of a lemon elderflower cake is a departure from the royal tradition of serving British fruit cake on the wedding day.  William and Kate had two cakes on their wedding day in 2011, a traditional eight-tier fruit cake created by chef Fiona Cairns and a chocolate biscuit cake from a beloved Buckingham Palace recipe.  See the gilded wedding invitations  Roughly 600 invitations to Harry and Markle's wedding have been issued, Kensington Palace announced in late March.  Victoria Jones/Pool via AP  The invitations are printed in gold and black on English card using American ink, a process that some saw as a nod to Markle's American roots.  Issued “in the name of His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales,\" each invitation is accented with gilded edges and features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales, according to Kensington Palace. The names of invited guests were added by a calligraphy printer.

Among the high-profile guests who could attend Harry and Markle's wedding are some of Markle's celebrity friends, including actress Priyanka Chopra and tennis star Serena Williams.  Getty Images  Former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama will not be at the wedding at Windsor Castle, despite speculation they would attend. It is unclear whether the Obamas received an invitation but declined to avoid a political distraction.  Markle and Harry decided against inviting political leaders from the U.K. and abroad to their wedding, meaning President Donald Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May will not attend.  Markle has though invited several members of the cast of \"Suits,\" the TV show she starred on for seven seasons, ABC News has learned. Also expected to attend the wedding ceremony is Elton John, one of Diana’s closest friends who has worked with Harry on AIDs policy.  Singers Ed Sheeran and Rihanna and members of Coldplay, who have all actively supported Harry's charitable work, could also get invites.  Spice Girls star Mel B said on a talk show in February that all five Spice Girls have been invited to Harry and Markle's wedding.  Stefan Wermuth/Reuters, FILE  Mel B declined to comment on whether the Spice Girls would perform on the big day, saying, \"You’re going to get me fired! Let’s not talk about it anymore! Let’s pretend that I never said that.”  Other members of the girl band have since indicated they will not be performing.  Prince William and Princess Kate invited Ellie Goulding to perform at their wedding reception in 2011.  Everyday people will play a role  Harry and Markle have invited 2,640 people onto the grounds of Windsor Castle to see the wedding carriage procession as it departs.  Matt Dunham/AP  Members of the public were selected from different regions of the U.K. with a special emphasis on those who have served their community. The couple also invited 100 students from two local schools in Windsor that have a strong affiliation with Windsor Castle.  Harry and Markle also extended invitations to 200 individuals who take part in charities and organizations for which Harry serves as royal patron.  Armed Forces will play a role too  More than 250 members of the Armed Forces will provide ceremonial support at both the wedding and the carriage procession, according to the U.K. Ministry of Defense.  \"Members of the Household Cavalry will form a staircase party at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle as part of the wedding,\" the statement reads. \"The State Trumpeters and a Captain’s Escort from the Household Cavalry will also provide ceremonial support.\"  The members will come from British Armed Forces units with a “special relationship” to Harry, a veteran. Harry served two tours of duty in Afghanistan and rose to the rank of Captain during his time in the military.  Prince Harry and Ms. Markle are pleased that members of the Armed Forces will play such a special role in their Wedding. The Military, and these units in particular, hold a great significance for Prince Harry and the couple are incredibly grateful for their support. — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) March 28, 2018  Is Markle planning this all on her own?

George Pimentel/Getty Images  Mulroney is Canada’s best-known stylist who styled Markle during her seven-season run on the TV drama \"Suits,\" which films in Toronto.  Since Markle's engagement to Harry, Mulroney helped select the dress and coat Markle wore on the day the couple's engagement was announced in November. Mulroney was also at Markle's side advising her on the gown and sweater Markle wore for her intimate engagement photos with Harry.  Mulroney is the wife of Ben Mulroney, whose father is a former prime minister of Canada. The two are one of Canada's best-known power couples and are often considered Canadian royalty in Toronto.  Who is paying for this celebration?  Kensington Palace confirmed in a statement released after the couple’s engagement that Harry’s family would pay for the “core aspects of the wedding.”  \"As was the case with the wedding of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, The Royal Family will pay for the core aspects of the wedding, such as the church service, the associated music, flowers, decorations, and the reception afterwards,” the statement read.  Markle is expected to pay for her wedding dress. Security costs for the wedding day will come at the expense of U.K. taxpayers.

But they both think that when the moment feels right, that will be the time to go for it.”  How long should they wait to have kids? Experts say factors to evaluate before having children include their ages and the stability of the reationship.

In fact, instead of best men, those who are with the groom on the day are usually called 'supporters'. However, Harry isn't the first royal to change the protocol, as Prince William asked him to be his best men at his wedding to Catherine Middleton back in 2011.  Prince Harry has asked William to be his best man  The couple announced it months before their big day, while Prince Harry and Meghan confirmed the news just three weeks before their wedding on 19 May. According to The Times, William opted for the term as it \"had more relevance to his life than the alternative\". Meanwhile, their father Prince Charles had his younger brothers, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, as his 'supporters' during his wedding to Diana, Princess of Wales in 1981, and Edward had his two brothers as supporters on his own wedding day.

            "text: The Line of Succession to the British Throne  Who will be the next King or Queen?  HRH Prince Charles, The Prince of Wales  Prince Charles is presently heir (next in line) to the British throne. He will not become king until his mother, Queen Elizabeth, abdicates (gives up the throne), retires or dies. When either of these happen, Prince Charles may abdicate and pass the throne to his eldest son Prince William. What is the title of the heir to the British throne? The heir to the throne is always called the Prince of Wales. The title was introduced by King Edward l in 1301, after the conquest of Wales. If the eldest child of the monarch is female, will she become heir to the throne? Yes, if she does not have any brothers. No, if she has a brother. In Britain the crown was normally passed from monarch to eldest son. As King George VI had no son, it passed to his elder daughter, now Queen Elizabeth II. If a monarch had sons, they took precedence over daughters: thus, although HR The Princess Royal is older than her brothers HRH The Duke of York and HRH The Earl of Wessex, they (and their children) precede her in the order of succession. From 2013, this all changes. Now the oldest child in herit the throne regardless of being a daughter or a son. This means that if William and Kate had had a daughter she would have inherited the throne even if she had a younger brother. The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 Succession to the Crown not to depend on gender  In determining the succession to the Crown, the gender of a person born after 28 October 2011 does not give that person, or that person's descendants, precedence over any other person (whenever born). Who can be heir to the British throne? Up until 2013, the succession in the United Kingdom was governed by the Act of Union 1800, which restated the provisions of the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Bill of Rights (1689). Pre 2013 'Only Protestant heirs of Princess Sophia, granddaughter of James I, may succeed to the British throne. Neither Catholics, nor those who marry a Catholic, nor those born out of wedlock, may remain in the line of succession.' The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 2. Removal of disqualification arising from marriage to a Roman Catholic  A person is not disqualified from succeeding to the Crown or from possessing it as a result of marrying a person of the Roman Catholic faith.  The current Royal Line of Succession is:  (see also the Royal Family Tree ) HRH The Prince Charles, The Prince of Wales (1948), eldest son of HM Queen Elizabeth II HRH Prince William of Wales (1982), elder son of HRH The Prince Charles, The Prince of Wales Prince George of Cambridge (b 2013), son of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge  HRH Prince Henry of Wales (popularly referred to as Prince Harry), (1984), younger son of HRH The Prince Charles, The Prince of Wales HRH The Prince Andrew, The Duke of York (1960), second son of HM Queen Elizabeth II HRH Princess Beatrice of York (1988), elder daughter of HRH The Prince Andrew, The Duke of York HRH Princess Eugenie of York (1990), younger daughter of HRH The Prince Andrew, The Duke of York HRH The Prince Edward, The Earl of Wessex (1964), youngest son of HM Queen Elizabeth II James Windsor, Viscount Severn (2007), son of HRH The Prince Edward, The Earl of Wessex Lady Louise Windsor (2003), daughter of HRH The Prince Edward, The Earl of Wessex HRH The Princess Anne, The Princess Royal (1950), only daughter of HM Queen Elizabeth II Peter Phillips (1977), son of HRH The Princess Anne, The Princess Royal Zara Phillips (1981), daughter of HRH The Princess Anne, The Princess Royal David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley (1961), son of HRH The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon The Honourable Charles Armstrong-Jones (1999), son of David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley The Honourable Margarita Armstrong-Jones (2002), daughter of David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley Lady Sarah Chatto (1964), daughter of HRH The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon Samuel Chatto (1996), son of Lady Sarah Chatto Arthur Chatto (1999), son of Lady Sarah Chatto HRH Prince Richard, The Duke of Gloucester (1944), son of HRH The Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, 3rd son of HM King George V  Royal Family Tree\n",

The engaged couple is moving ahead with wedding planning, but has hit a major hurdle, according to the story.  The magazine reports that Queen Elizabeth has seen \"too many royal marriages end in divorce\" and doesn't want her grandson to \"take any chances with his reported $40 million fortune.\" That's led to tension between the spouses-to-be, with a source sharing, \"Meghan can see where the queen is coming from, but at the same time, she's insulted that it would even cross the queen's mind that Meghan would have an ulterior motive for marrying Harry.\"  The actress \"loves Harry, and money is the last thing on her mind,\" relates the insider. But Queen Elizabeth is nonetheless pressuring her heir to make sure the family's money is protected, explains the publication. Consequently, the outlet says that means Prince Harry and Markle are clashing over the situation.  It is true there have been a number of divorces across the monarchy over the years, but no one has ever laid claim to royal possessions and there's no evidence that a British royal has ever signed a prenuptial agreement. As such, Gossip Cop is told this \"first fight\" tale is entirely \"untrue.\" Tellingly, it also comes from the same tabloid that falsely claimed Markle was pregnant in October.\n",

            "text: God save Meghan Markle! The Duchess Of Sussex has run into some issues when it comes to her royal behavior, but she has her husband Prince Harry to support her through it!  Meghan Markle was just accused of breaking royal protocol and “disrespecting the Queen” when she crossed her legs at a royal engagement. Shortly after, she attempted to hold Prince Harry’s hand in public — which just isn’t what the royals do. Still, she’s only been a Duchess for a month and a half, so the Royal Family is cutting her some slack, even though she’s incredibly hard on herself. “Meghan does worry about messing up, she worries terribly, because she wants to do everything perfectly, so she really beats herself up when she gets even the tiniest thing wrong. But, there is so much to remember, so many minuscule little details, it’s kind of mind-blowing really–and all incredibly high pressured too, as it’s all under a microscope at the same time,” a palace insider told HollywoodLife.com exclusively.  “The funny thing is that the Queen is actually incredibly gracious to Meghan, she doesn’t put any pressure on her at all, it’s actually quite the opposite, and Harry is so loving and supportive, he’s constantly telling Meghan how amazing she’s doing, and how quickly she’s learning, and she is!” Aww! Listen, if the Queen doesn’t have a problem, we don’t have a problem.  At Meghan and Harry’s royal nuptials on May 18, the duchess seemed ready to commit to her role as a royal — singing God Save The Queen flawlessly, and crossing her legs at her ankles. Her few faux pas, while understandable to the royal family, are reportedly devastating to her. “The British press is constantly jumping on each and every little faux pas though, and publicly reprimanding Meghan, it’s horrible really, and some days she ends up in tears,” the insider revealed. “Harry is so protective of Meghan, and he hates how some of the newspapers write about her, it reminds him of his mother, and the way she was treated by the press, and sometimes Harry worries that nothing has really changed.” Recall, the British tabloids were incredibly tough on Princess Diana, but if Meghan is anything like her she’ll continue to handle herself with impeccable class!\n",

A smoking hot Kourtney Kardashian posed in front of her nude portrait at a gallery event for photographer Brian Bowen Smith on Thursday, Oct. 22, several weeks after her ex Scott Disick shared the same racy snap via Instagram.  The portrait of Kardashian, which was on display at the De Re Gallery in West Hollywood as part of Smith's \"Metallic Life\" exhibit, is a monochromatic photo that features the reality star's naked backside. The mom of three, 36, happily posed beside the artwork alongside Smith, whose work was also recently published on Vanity Fair's website.  PHOTOS: Kourt and Scott during happier days  Disick posted the nude portrait of his ex via Instagram on Oct. 8, adding the caption: \"Now that's 1 hot mama.\"  PHOTOS: Keeping Up With Kourt -- how she stays fit and fab  As first reported by Us Weekly, Disick is currently seeking treatment for drug and alcohol addiction at a Malibu rehab center. Meanwhile, Kardashian has been caring for their three kids, Mason, 5, Penelope, 3, and Reign, 10 months. The longtime partners split this past July after nine years together.  Kardashian was joined inside the gallery by Selma Blair, who is currently portraying Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner in the FX anthology series American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson, about the former NFL player's murder trial.  PHOTOS: Kardashians in swimsuits in St. Barts  \"I'm excited to see Kourtney,\" Blair told Us Weekly inside the event. \"I think she's a wonderful mother. And that photograph is beautiful of her.\"  An observer tells Us that the KUWTK star, who was supported by pals at the gallery, walked out the door with a group of four ladies. \"They were all holding hands and they walked a block down the street,\" the observer says, adding that Kardashian was \"clearly having a good time.\"  PHOTOS: Kourt's body evolution  Post gallery vino with my bitches.

Lamar Odom Overdosed on Cocaine and Other Drugs: Report  Authorities suspect that Lamar Odom overdosed on cocaine and other drugs before he was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel earlier this month, the Associated Press reports.  PHOTOS: Khloe's body evolution  The AP obtained search warrant records on Thursday, Oct. 23, that included testimony from Michael Eisenloffel, a Nye County sheriff's detective.  \"I believe that Mr. Odom may be — or may have been — under the influence of a controlled substance,\" Eisenloffel stated.  In addition, Eisenloffel said onlookers claimed that the former NBA star ingested \"an unknown substance in the form of an unidentified pill, which he obtained from his pocket,\" and prostitutes \"heard him snorting.\"  PHOTOS: Khloe and Lamar's wedding album  TMZ reported on Thursday that Khloe Kardashian's husband, 35 — the pair have decided to dismiss their divorce case — underwent two emergency surgeries at L.A.'s Cedars-Sinai Hospital. Visitors have reportedly been banned, but Kardashian, 31, continues to remain by his side.  \"This is a huge wakeup call for Lamar, for his friends and family,\" a source told Us. \"Everyone is just really hoping for the best.\"  PHOTOS: Celebrity health scares  As previously reported, the Kardashian-Jenner clan visited Odom at Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas before he was transferred to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in L.A. on Monday. The athlete's ex Liza Morales and their children — Destiny and Lamar Jr. — also visited him in Las Vegas. On Thursday, Morales and the kids were spotted in NYC.  Dr. Drew Talks Teen Mom 2's Leah Messer: \"I Was Expecting Progress\"  Following reports that Leah Messer lost primary custody of her twins, Ali and Aleeah, Dr. Drew Pinsky, who moderates the Teen Mom 2 reunion specials, spoke out about the West Virginia native.  PHOTOS: Leah Messer's family album  Admitting he could not confirm the reports, the addiction specialist, 57, spoke about Messer in a backstage interview on The Rachael Ray Show.  “She is a dedicated mother,” he said. “If you saw the last reunion show, which is the last time I had contact with her, I believed she was making some progress.”  PHOTOS: Teen Mom stars, then and now  Though the reunion special, which was taped in July and aired earlier this month, featured a tense confrontation between Messer and her ex-husband Corey Simms and his wife, Miranda, Dr. Drew didn’t think that was cause for concern.  “People around her were starting to really come down on her,” he noted. “When that starts to happen, that’s a real sign that the identified patient — whatever her condition is, mental health issue — is getting better. When somebody is aware enough that the people who have been so worried and frustrated around them can actually hear them that’s when they come down on them. So I told Leah that I thought that was a good sign and she should learn to tolerate it.”  PHOTOS: Stars battling mental health issues  The custody battle between Messer and Simms, which has been closely documented on Teen Mom 2, was ugly throughout Season 6. Simms accused his ex-wife of having a pill addiction and endangering their daughters. (Messer is also mom to daughter Addie with her ex-husband Jeremy Calvert.)  Messer has never admitted to a drug addiction and passed a court-ordered drug test on the show. In June she went to a rehabilitation facility for 30 days for treatment for depression. On the reunion special, Dr. Drew also alluded to the fact that Messer’s mental illness had led to a previously undisclosed hospitalization.  PHOTOS: Stars who have been to rehab  “I was expecting progress,” Dr. Drew said on Rachael Ray. “I certainly wish her the best. She is working very hard. It’s been a terribly painful and stressful time for her.”  Neither Messer nor Simms have confirmed the reports about the new custody arrangement.

Caitlyn Jenner Wears Kate Middleton's Engagement Dress: Who Wore It Best  There are some fashion moments we'll remember forever. One of them happens to be the navy blue Issa London wrap dress that Kate Middleton wore for her engagement announcement to Prince William.  PHOTOS: The royal wedding album  Back in 2010, the Duchess of Cambridge, now 33, paired the shiny V-neck frock with a dainty necklace, sensible black pumps, and, of course, her matching sapphire engagement ring. With the \"Kate Effect\" in full swing, the dress reportedly sold out within 24 hours of her wearing it.  PHOTOS: Kate Middleton's recycled dresses  However, it's clearly back in stock. On Wednesday, Oct. 21, the Issa London \"Phylis\" style resurfaced in L.A. on Caitlyn Jenner. The I Am Cait star, 65, whose own style is focused on ladylike wrap dresses and cozy sweaters, took a cue from Middleton, pairing her version of the knee-length number with similar black heels, this time in a sling-back style. Jenner carried a matching black handbag, and accessorized with simple stud earrings and a chain-link bracelet. The only difference between the two dresses is that the former Olympian wore the wrapped ties as a bow in the front, while Middleton tied her dress in the back.

The physician passed away from natural causes in Palm Springs, Fla., on Thursday, Oct. 22. He was 70.  PHOTOS: Stars gone too soon  According to TMZ, Klein admitted himself into a hospital earlier this week when he was feeling abdominal pains. He was wheelchair-bound and also suffered from multiple sclerosis.  The L.A.-based dermatologist treated the late Jackson for several years until the legendary singer's death in 2009. Over time, he's continued to dodge questions of rumors that he's the biological father of Jackson's two oldest children, Prince, 18, and Paris, 17.  Back in 2009, Klein admitted during Larry King Live that he once donated sperm, but only to a bank. \"Here's the most important thing. Michael loved those children. Those children loved him as a father,\" he told King at the time. \"As far as I am concerned, that's the most important grouping there is.\"  PHOTOS: Celebrity deaths 2015  \"That's not answering the question,\" King replied. Klein quipped back: \"No, because I'm not going to answer it the way you want me to answer it because…I will say no if that's what you want to hear.\" (Klein has never denied that he's the dad.)  Story is still developing.  Kate Middleton, Prince William Spend Night Where They First Met  Back when they were two young undergrads, Kate Middleton and Prince William met and fell in love at the University of St. Andrews in Fife, Scotland. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took a trip down memory lane on Thursday, Oct. 22, staying at the five-star Old Course Hotel where they enjoyed a romantic date night away from the kids.

After greeting the massive crowds outside of the Dundee Repertory Theatre, they joined Prince Harry to support the Scottish Mental Health Arts and Film Festival.  Middleton, 33, wore a custom Christopher Kane blue coat and kilt paired with her go-to Aquatalia boots, while her husband, also 33, wore a navy suit with a red tie.  PHOTOS: Prince George's baby album  At the theatre, the mother of Prince George and Princess Charlotte was intrigued by an 8-year-old girl named Evie Will who was wearing a mask of Queen Elizabeth.  “Where did you find that?” she asked the little girl, laughing.  Little Evie later opened up to Us Weekly and other reporters about meeting Prince William, saying, “He was asking me what I like at school and what productions I have seen at the theatre, and I said I like maths and I've seen James and the Giant Peach and the BFG. He said that he didn't like maths. It was cool to meet them, but I was kind of scared.\"  PHOTOS: Kate Middleton's recycled outfits  One well-wisher asked the Duchess if William was still a fan of his motorbike.  \"He's still riding it,” she replied. “It always fills me with horror when he goes out on it. I'm terrified… ? Hopefully, I'm going to keep George off it.\"  Amanda Lowsen, the Community and Wellbeing Facilitator at the theatre, noted of the Royals, \"They were very relaxed. A lot of the mums were saying it's great to come to something all together as a family and they were nodding and seemed to understand that.\"  William and Kate later visited The Corner, a drop-in center for teens wanting advice on issues like contraception or exam stress, and then joined in an anti-bullying workshop organized by Scottish organization, RespectMe.  Mila Kunis: I'd Bury a Body for My Baby Daughter Wyatt  Too funny! Mila Kunis loves her baby girl, Wyatt, so much that she would personally help bury the body if her daughter killed someone, the actress said on Thursday, Oct. 22.  “I think if she killed someone, I would literally be like, ‘I got it,’” Kunis, 32, told Business Insider of her 12-month-old daughter. “‘Where do you want me to bury the body?’ I wouldn’t even question it. I can’t say that about anybody else in my life.”  PHOTOS: Mila's pregnancy style  Kunis, who married Ashton Kutcher this past July, shared additional details about how motherhood has changed her.  PHOTOS: Ashton and Mila's romance  “Everything is different,” the Black Swan actress noted. “From the fact that you’re so happy when you get six hours of sleep to the idea of being responsible for this incredible, living breathing little human being that you can’t believe is yours,” she gushed.  PHOTOS: Mila's sexy transformation  Kunis also said that she brings baby Wyatt to work with her every day. “I’m super lucky that I could work from home, so to speak,” she said. “My office is downstairs.

The actress also reflected on the possibility of having more children down the road.  “I mean, not today,” the Jupiter Ascending star revealed. “I’m not pregnant. But yeah, absolutely, for sure!”  Kim K. Reminisces About Birthday Engagement: \"Best Surprise Ever!\"  Sigh, memories.

May 19's royal wedding has easily been one of the year's biggest events, not to mention a huge moment in the history of bridal fashion and beauty. Now, nearly 12 hours into the day, the couple can finally put their feet up. Just kidding; they're off to a royal evening reception at Frogmore House, a location that's undoubtedly less awesome than its name, where they'll celebrate with family, friends, and fellow royals. For this, Markle changed into a reception dress that's just as divine as her ceremony gown.  The freshly married couple exited Windsor Castle, each having switched to a brand-new look. Both Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, looked less formal than in the chapel earlier, but still just as classic and sophisticated. Markle's reception dress, a long white gown made of silk crepe by British designer Stella McCartney, featured a halter-style neckline and the same type of effortless elegance as every other element of the bride's wedding-day look.  Steve Parsons/WPA Pool/Getty Images  Harry, on the other hand, changed out of his official frockcoat uniform and into a classic black tuxedo, complete with a black bowtie around his neck and an adorable just-married grin across his face.

            "text: PIPPA Middleton was thrust into the public eye after her bum became the star of the show at her sister Kate's wedding to Prince William back in 2011.  And she recently married hedge fund manager James Matthews - whose brother is ex Made In Chelsea star Spencer. Here's what we know about the mum of one...  Reuters 8 Pippa is a socialite and sister to Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge  Who is Pippa Middleton and what is her net worth?  Philippa Middleton, known to most as Pippa, is the middle child of the three Middleton children - Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and James William Middleton, an entrepreneur whose company sells cake-making kits for birthdays.  The 35-year-old socialite graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a degree in English literature, something she later put to use by releasing her own non-fiction book, Celebrate, in 2012.  Prior to her wedding, she was once voted the Number 1 Society Singleton by Tatler magazine.  According to some estimates, Pippa is worth approximately £750,000.  However, she is most known for almost stealing the spotlight from her sister's marriage by wearing a bridesmaid's dress that turned her bum into a national talking point.  Since then she has been seen at a number of high-class social events and remains close to her sister, but ran into trouble when a data thief hacked into her iCloud and stole thousands of personal pictures.  Getty - Contributor 8 Pippa has one child with husband James Matthews  On October 15, heavily pregnant Pippa Middleton reportedly arrived at the £7,500-a-night Lindo Wing maternity unit - just days after Prince Eugenie's royal wedding.  The younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge is said to have been joined at the private hospital with her financier husband James Matthews.  James was pictured carrying two overnight bags as they entered the wing - a £78 Cam Cam Copenhagen baby changing bag and another holdall.  Eyewitnesses say Pippa, 35, was seen smiling as she entered the Lindo Wing, where her nephews Prince George and Prince Louis and niece Princess Charlotte were born.  That afternoon, Pippa gave birth to the couple's son weighing 8lb 9oz at the Lindo Wing.  It's said the family are delighted with the new arrival and mother and baby are doing well.  The Sun on Sunday revealed back in April the Duchess of Cambridge’s younger sister, 35, and financier husband James Matthews, 43, had announced the news to their friends and family after a 12-week scan.  The Duchess of Cambridge \"could not have been more delighted\" on learning little sister Pippa was pregnant, a friend revealed.  Kate, who gave birth to her third child on April 23, was the first person after Pippa’s husband James to hear the good news.  AP:Associated Press 8 Pippa Middleton holds a bouquet of lilies, peonies and sweet peas from the same London florist as her sister  How did Pippa announce her pregnancy?  After months of reports and rumours surrounding her suspected pregnancy, Pippa Middleton finally confirmed that she is expecting her first child.  Taking to her Waitrose magazine food column to announce the happy news, Pippa wrote: \"I was lucky to pass the 12 week scan without suffering from morning sickness.\"  Unlike older sister Kate who has experienced hyperemesis gravidarum with each of her three pregnancies, Pippa has been fortunate enough to avoid the rate morning sickness condition that led to the Duchess of Cambridge being hospitalised for dehydration.  A fitness buff and marathon runner, Pippa also revealed she has also \"stopped running\" only because she \"rather liked the idea\" of giving herself and the baby \"a rest from pavement pounding.\"  Rumoured to be due in October 2018, the petite Middleton sister gave a glimpse of her growing baby bump at the French Open in June 2018.  She then gave the world a full view of her blossoming bump at the nuptials of Princess Eugenie and James Brooksbank, dressing a gorgeous emerald green midi dress.  Getty - Contributor 8 Pippa showed off her growing baby bump at the 2018 French Open - the 35-year-old is a keen tennis fan  What did Pippa name her first child?  Pippa and James named their firstborn Arthur Michael William Matthews.  The second name is of significance as not only is it Pippa's father's name but it also belonged to James' younger brother who died in a tragic mountaineering accident on Everest in 1999, just after becoming the youngest British man to climb to its peak.  PA:Press Association 8 James proposed to Pippa in July 2016  Who is Pippa married to?  James Matthews, 42, is a hedge fund manager and is also the older brother of former Made in Chelsea star Spencer Matthews.  He caught her off-guard by popping the question to her in July 2016, less than a year into their relationship.  James proposed with the hefty octagonal diamond ring, which comes with a central 4-carat Asscher-cut diamond stone, and a price tag to rival sister Kate’s own luxury ring.  With an estimated cost of £200,000, the pricey band also boasts a halo of flawless diamonds around the centre - although it’s unclear exactly who designed it.  EPA 8 Pippa is married to millionaire James Matthews  When did Pippa Middleton and James Matthews get married?  Pippa Middleton became Mrs Pippa Matthews on May 20, 2017.  The pair enjoyed a relaxed but lavish intimate ceremony at her local church, St Mark’s Church in Englefield.  We showcased pictures of the stunning venue, which is just six miles from where the Middletons grew up.  The party was held at her parents’ £5million home in nearby Bucklebury, Berks.  A £100,000 marquee was erected at the Grade II Listed location, as the bride-to-be was determined to keep the rain off her guests.  It was also revealed that guests were treated to a Spitfire fly-by.  It is estimated the society ceremony of the year cost £250,000 – ten times the UK average - and that the ceremony took place in front of 350 guests.  Who was invited to James and Pippa's wedding?  Pippa's big sister Kate was there along with the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, who she has struck up a friendship with.  Pippa's niece and nephew Prince George and Princess Charlotte had starring roles in the nuptials.  George was a pageboy while Charlotte was one of her auntie's bridesmaids.  Prior to the big day Kate revealed her nerves at how her two children would behave.  Pippa’s younger brother James was also at the nuptials and so was his on-off girlfriend, the TV presenter and actress, Donna Air.  All of James' family attended with his former reality TV star brother Spencer on best man duties.

Pippa's book Celebrate - which focused on social etiquette and party organising - was a widely ridiculed flop, due to Pippa’s obvious observations such as: “There is something very British about tea” and “put a pitcher of water and glasses on a nearby table or side table.”  Last year Pippa filmed a series of reports for US talk programme Today.  But despite being offered £400,000 by the NBC channel, she decided against working full time in the States.

            "text: Duchess of Sussex redirects here. For the title, see Duke of Sussex  American member of the British royal family, and former actress  Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (born Rachel Meghan Markle; August 4, 1981), is an American-born member of the British royal family and a former film and television actress.  Markle was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and is of mixed-race heritage. During her studies at Northwestern University, she began playing small roles in American television series and films. From 2011 to 2017, she played her best-known role, Rachel Zane, on the American legal drama series Suits. As an outspoken feminist, Markle has addressed issues of gender inequality, and her lifestyle website The Tig featured a column profiling influential women. Her humanitarian work in the 2010s saw her represent international charity organizations. She has received recognition for her fashion and style, releasing a line of clothing in 2016.  From 2011 until their divorce in 2013, Markle was married to actor and producer Trevor Engelson. In 2017, she announced her engagement to Prince Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, and moved to London. She consequently retired from acting, closed her social media accounts, and started undertaking public engagements on behalf of the British royal family. Following their wedding on May 19, 2018, Markle became known as the Duchess of Sussex.  Early life and education  Rachel Meghan Markle was born on August 4, 1981, in Los Angeles, California,[1] at West Park Hospital in Canoga Park.[2] As of 2017, her mother, Doria Ragland, a social worker and yoga instructor lives in View Park–Windsor Hills, California.[1][3] Markle has often described a very close friendship with her mother.[4] Her father, Thomas Markle Sr., who lives in Rosarito, Mexico,[5][6] is a retired television director of photography and lighting director, whose profession resulted in his young daughter often visiting the set of Married...with Children.[7][8] Markle's parents divorced when she was six years old.[9][10] She has two older paternal half-siblings, Thomas Markle Jr. and Samantha Markle, from whom she is reportedly estranged.[11]  Describing her heritage in a 2015 essay for Elle, Markle states that her \"dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I'm half black and half white ... While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.\"[12]  Markle grew up in Hollywood.[13] She was educated at private schools, beginning at age two at the Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse.[14][15] At age 11, her successful campaign to get Proctor & Gamble to change a national television commercial she viewed as sexist was profiled by Linda Ellerbee on Nick News.[16] Though she was raised as a Protestant,[17] Markle attended Immaculate Heart High School, an all-girl Catholic private school in Los Angeles.[18] She then attended Northwestern University, where she joined Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and participated in community service and charity projects.[19][20] Markle graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 2003 with a bachelor's degree and a double major in theater and international studies.[21][22] She also served an internship at the American embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina,[22] and studied for a semester in Madrid, Spain.[20]  Acting career  Early in her career, Markle worked as a freelance calligrapher to support herself between acting jobs.[7] Her first on-screen appearance was a small role as a nurse in an episode of the daytime soap opera General Hospital.[23][24] Markle had small guest roles on the television shows Century City (2004), The War at Home (2006), and CSI: NY (2006).[24] She also took on several contract acting and modeling jobs, including a stint as a \"briefcase girl\" on the US game show Deal or No Deal.[7] She appeared in Fox's series Fringe as Junior Agent Amy Jessup in the first two episodes of its second season.[25] Markle had some difficulty getting roles early in her career. In 2015, she wrote: \"Being 'ethnically ambiguous', as I was pegged in the industry, meant I could audition for virtually any role ... Sadly, it didn't matter: I wasn't black enough for the black roles and I wasn't white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn't book a job.\"[26]  In July 2011, Markle joined the cast of the USA Network show Suits, playing Rachel Zane. The character began as a paralegal and eventually became an attorney. She completed work on the seventh season in late 2017.[27] According to a critique in The Irish Times, Markle deftly and \"actively re-positioned\" her character from ingenue to \"the show's moral conscience\" and gave viewers the unique portrayal of a daughter, whose African-American father is in a position to help her career and advance her \"desire to crack both racial and gender glass ceilings\".[28] She appeared in two 2010 films, Get Him to the Greek and Remember Me, and one 2011 film, Horrible Bosses.[29] She also appeared in episodes of Cuts; Love, Inc.; 90210; Knight Rider; Without a Trace; The League; and Castle.[24][30]  From 2014 to 2017, she was founder and editor-in-chief of the lifestyle website The Tig,[31][32] a name she derived from Tignanello red wine.[33] One of The Tig's features was \"Tig Talk\", a column that profiled women including Jessica Alba,[34] Gail Simmons,[35] Ella Woodward,[36] Daphne Oz,[37] Elizabeth Hurley,[38] Lauren Bush,[39] Ivanka Trump,[40] Dianna Agron[41] and Jessica Stam.[42] She closed The Tig in April 2017,[43] and in January 2018, she deleted all of her social media accounts. At the time of its closing, her Instagram account had 1.9 million followers.[44] In a statement issued by Kensington Palace, Markle thanked \"everyone who has followed her social media accounts over the years\".[45][46]  In November 2016, Markle and Canadian clothing company Reitmans released lines of women's fashion workwear and casual-wear.[47] The lines, based on her personal style, and that of her Suits character, described as \"aspirational girl next door\", quickly sold out.[44] In 2010, Markle was paid $187,000 for her role in Remember Me and $171,429 for her role in the short film The Candidate.[48] For her role on Suits, Fortune magazine estimated that Markle was paid $50,000 per episode, amounting to an annual salary of about $450,000.[49] In addition, it was estimated that as a lifestyle blogger she earned about $80,000 annually from endorsements and sponsorships.[48] In 2017, her total net worth was estimated at $5 million.[48] In 2018, she was among the nominees for the 2018 Teen Choice Awards in the category Choice Style Icon.[50]  Personal life  Markle began a relationship with actor and producer Trevor Engelson in 2004.[51][52] They married in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, on September 10, 2011,[53] and separated through a no-fault divorce in August 2013,[54] citing irreconcilable differences.[55]  Markle was in a relationship with celebrity chef and restaurateur Cory Vitiello for almost two years.[56] They lived together in their residence in Toronto.[57] Their relationship ended in May 2016.[56]  Markle and Prince Harry attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  In June 2016, Markle began a relationship with Prince Harry,[58][59] who was then fifth in line to the British throne.[60] Markle and Prince Harry met on a blind date set up by a mutual friend.[61] The press began to report on the relationship in October 2016.[62] On November 8, 2016, the British royal family's communications secretary released an official statement that addressed a \"wave of abuse and harassment\" directed toward Markle.[63] The statement described sexism, racism and defamatory stories directed at her.[64][65][66] During a September 2017 interview with Vanity Fair, Markle spoke in public for the first time about her love for Prince Harry.[67] Later that month, they made their first public appearance together at an official royal engagement at the Invictus Games in Toronto.[68][69]  While working on Suits, Markle lived in a rented house in the Seaton Village neighborhood of Toronto, Canada, where the show is filmed.[70] She lived in Canada for nine months each year, making a few close friends.[44] She moved out in late November 2017 after work on the seventh season had been completed.[71]  Markle has two rescue dogs, a labrador-shepherd named Bogart and a beagle named Guy, whom she adopted in 2012 and 2015 respectively.[72][73]  Royal marriage  Markle's engagement to Prince Harry was announced on November 27, 2017.[58][74] By then, she had met Queen Elizabeth II, Harry's paternal grandmother, several times.[75] The engagement announcement prompted generally positive comment about the possible social significance of a mixed-race member of the royal family.[76] The ring Harry gave Markle consists of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from the jewellery collection of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.[77] Following the engagement, Markle announced she would retire from acting,[78][79] and began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[80]  In preparation for the wedding, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, baptised Markle and confirmed her into the Church of England on March 6, 2018.[81] The private ceremony, performed with water from the River Jordan, took place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace.[81] The marriage ceremony was held on May 19, 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[82] The Duke and Duchess live at Nottingham Cottage in London, in the grounds of Kensington Palace.[83]  Public life  Markle greeting the public in Belfast, March 2018  Markle accompanied Harry for the first time during an official public appearance after their engagement at a walkabout in Nottingham on December 1, 2017,[84][85] in connection with World AIDS Day.[86] The Queen invited them to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at her Sandringham estate.[87] In early 2018, Markle accompanied Harry on his engagements in Brixton,[86] Cardiff,[88] Goldsmiths' Hall,[89] and Edinburgh.[90] On February 28, 2018, Markle attended an official engagement at the first annual forum of The Royal Foundation, \"Making a Difference Together\" with the prince.[91] She became the fourth patron, alongside Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, after her marriage into the royal family.[92] Markle and Harry marked International Women's Day by attending an event in Birmingham hosted by the Stemettes.[93] Along with the Queen and other members of the royal family, she attended the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on March 12, 2018.[94] The couple made their first visit to Northern Ireland on March 23, 2018.[95] Markle carried out a total of 26 public engagements prior to the wedding.[96]  The Duchess's first official engagement after the wedding came on May 22 when she and her husband attended Prince Charles' 70th birthday garden party to celebrate his charity work.[97] Her first trip abroad at the request of the British government was to Dublin, Ireland, in July 2018.[98][99] According to a review in The Irish Times, her visit became a unique national obsession.[100] In June 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the Duke and Duchess would tour Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand around the time of the Invictus Games which will be held in Sydney in October 2018.[101][102]  Fashion and style  Markle cited Emmanuelle Alt as her style inspiration in 2017.[103][104] In an interview with Glamour, the Duchess said that she favored \"that French way of styling, where if your outfit is pulled together, then something's got to be dishevelled—your hair, your make-up\".[103] In her youth, Markle's \"sensibility had always been relaxed California girl style\" consisting of jeans, cut-offs and flip-flops.[104] She usually prefers \"streamlined dresses\" with \"neutral colors\" and boat-neck necklines,[105][106] and likes \"monochromatic and tonal dressing\".[104] She has worn outfits and ensembles by many fashion designers.[103] The media takes note of the brands she uses.[103]  In December 2017, Markle caused a surge in interest in Scottish retailer Strathberry after carrying one of their handbags to a public event shortly after her engagement.[107][108] This was reported as an indication that her fashion choices would produce her own version of the Kate effect.[107][109] It has been speculated that Markle's effect would be greater, as she has a strong appeal in America.[109] After Markle and Prince Harry's first appearance as a couple, brands Mackage, Birks, R&R Jewelers, Crown Jewelers and Everlane noted an upswing in their website hits and sales.[110][111][108]  Charity work  Markle was a counselor for international charity One Young World. She attended its 2014 and 2016 summits.[112] At the 2014 summit in Dublin, she spoke on the topics of gender equality and modern-day slavery.[113] Also in 2014, she traveled to Afghanistan and Spain as part of the United Service Organizations Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Holiday Tour.[114][115][116]  In 2016, Markle became a global ambassador for World Vision Canada, traveling to Rwanda for the Clean Water Campaign, the agency's campaign to provide safe, clean drinking water,[117][118][26] and she traveled to India to raise awareness of issues concerning women.[119] Upon returning from India, she penned an op-ed for Time magazine concerning stigmatization of women in regard to menstrual health.[120] She has also worked with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women as an Advocate.[117][121] The Duchess is a vocal feminist and likely to use her role as a member of the royal family to continue supporting women's rights and social justice.[122]  In 2018, Time magazine included Markle on its list 100 Most Influential People in the World.[123][124] She was also chosen as one of the most influential women in the United Kingdom by Vogue magazine.[125]  Titles, styles, and arms  Titles and styles  Royal monogram  Upon her marriage to Prince Harry, Meghan Markle became a princess of the United Kingdom entitled to the style of Royal Highness, as well as Duchess of Sussex, Countess of Dumbarton and Baroness Kilkeel.[126][127] She is styled as \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex\",[128] and she is the first person to hold that title.[129]  Arms  Ancestry  On her mother's side, the Duchess of Sussex is descended from African Americans enslaved in Georgia,[132] and on her father's side from German,[133] English,[134] and Irish settlers.[135] One of her possible forefathers, Heinrich Martin Merckel, emigrated to the United States from Lampertsloch, an historically German-speaking town in Alsace, and later changed the spelling of his name to Markle.[133] Among her father's distant ancestors are Captain Christopher Hussey, King Robert I of Scotland, Sir Philip Wentworth, and Edward III of England.[136][137]  Filmography  Television  Film  References\n",

            "text: In February I saw a photo of Meghan Markle and the Duchess of Cambridge sitting next to each other at the Royal Foundation Forum, wearing colour coordinated dresses (lavender for Kate, deep purple-blue for Meghan). It wasn’t their dresses I minded, it was how they sat – legs crossed neatly at the ankle, knees pressed firmly together. It was that dulce et decorum pose passed down to generations of girls and young women expected to demonstrate their good breeding on social occasions – expected to show they are “ladies”. Both Kate and Meghan had folded their hands in their laps, the arms forming a gentle circle, the hands quietly clasped, as if ready to shelter a child or calm a kingdom’s cares. But it was the legs that haunted me – in part because I’d been taught that same bit of etiquette when I was a young black midwestern girl in the 1950s and early 60s, a child of the manners- and achievement-conscious black bourgeoisie, which in those days we called the Negro elite.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Meghan Markle and the Duchess of Cambridge at the Royal Foundation Forum. Photograph: Chris Jackson/AFP/Getty Images  In fact, things turned out better than I’d feared. In a subsequent photo Kate crossed her legs at the knee. And when both women were asked in the video about the causes they planned to take up, Meghan spoke out. The words “MeToo” and “Time’sUp” flowed from her lips. So did the words “I fundamentally disagree”, as in: “What’s interesting is … when speaking about girls’ and women’s empowerment you’ll often hear people say: ‘Well, you’re helping women find their voices,’ and I fundamentally disagree with that. Women don’t need to find a voice, they have a voice, and they need to feel empowered to use it, and people need to be encouraged to listen.”  Rachel Meghan Markle, for those who have chosen or somehow managed to miss the ceaseless chronicling of her life thus far, is the only daughter of Thomas Markle (white), an Emmy award-winning cinematographer and lighting designer, and Doria Ragland (black), a social worker and yoga instructor who focuses on community mental health. This union of white Hollywood and black social-spiritual activism made her the offspring of a modern and ever more varied biracial bourgeoisie.  The family settled in Woodland Hills, a prosperous Los Angeles neighbourhood. Prosperous and largely white: Meghan’s mother was regularly mistaken for her nanny there. This must have happened in the 80s and early 90s when she was a young girl; it still happens in the US to every black woman I know who has a mixed-race child.  Meghan’s parents divorced when she was six, and she lived with her mother after that, although she saw her father regularly. There are two half-siblings from his previous marriage, both quite a bit older. Relations with them, at least since the courtship and engagement, have been strained.  Timeline Prince Harry's relationship with Meghan Markle Show Hide  The pair meet in London through friends and begin a relationship. News breaks that the prince and Markle are dating. Kensington Palace confirms in an unprecedented statement that they are dating. The prince attacks the media over its “abuse and harassment” of his girlfriend.  Markle is spotted in London amid unconfirmed reports she is enjoying her first stay at Kensington Palace since the relationship was made public. Markle reportedly meets the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte for the first time in London.  The engagement looks set when Markle graces the cover of US magazine Vanity Fair and speaks openly about Harry for the first time, revealing: “We’re two people who are really happy and in love.” Markle makes her first appearance at an official engagement attended by the prince when she attends the Invictus Games opening ceremony in Toronto, Canada – although the pair sit about 18 seats apart. It emerges that the prince has taken Markle to meet his grandmother, the Queen, whose permission they need to marry. They met over afternoon tea at Buckingham Palace. The prince’s aides are reported to have been told to start planning for a royal wedding, with senior members of the royal family asked to look at their diaries to shortlist a series of suitable weekends in 2018. Markle is spotted in London, prompting speculation she is preparing for an engagement announcement. Clarence House announces the engagement, and the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh say they are “delighted for the couple and wish them every happiness”.  The couple marry before a celebrity-studded congregation at St George's Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle.    Markle majored in international relations and theatre at Northwestern University, Illinois. Besides becoming an actor, she became a feminist who worked for UN Women as an advocate for political participation and leadership. Yes, she has been praised and criticised as “outspoken”, but her style never risks being “aggressive” or “combative”, or any of the other words thrown at women who are deemed insufficiently graceful when they disagree with men. Even when she makes staunch political statements, her manner astutely – sometimes cloyingly – balances the forthright and the pleasing. She’s learned to use political maxims and assertions very effectively. As in: “It’s time to focus less on glass slippers and more on glass ceilings.” With the word “fairytale” now a ubiquitous tag line for the royal romance, this should be a useful daily mantra.  The Cinderella story refuses to dwindle into a period piece; in the last 20 years alone there have been six film remakes with white, black and Latina leads. But Markle has not been plucked from poverty or – like the heroines of such romcom adaptations as Pretty Woman and Maid in Manhattan – from the low-status toil and trouble of working-class life. Her net worth as an actor has been estimated at around $5m. An actor’s fortunes can fluctuate, especially when that actor is a woman. But so can the fortunes of a wife. If the royal marriage were to end in divorce, Markle would not have to depend on the Windsor millions nor, like many once-upon-a-time celebrities, design a skincare or jewellery line for QVC.  Any 'commoner' who marries into any royal family ​is seen as marrying up. But Harry is marrying up too, by marrying out  Love that results in the bride’s near magical social ascent is the key element in Cinderella tales. But is Markle automatically marrying up by marrying a prince? In the old school way, yes: any “commoner” who marries into any royal family is seen as marrying up. But Harry is marrying up too. He’s marrying up by marrying out – out of long-entwined bloodlines, out of entrenched rituals and hierarchies, out of a lineage as constricted as it is privileged. We always ascribe social ambitions to commoners, but aristocrats have their own longings for a world elsewhere. Harry is marrying into all the possibilities of postmodernity. It’s a world where – as Zora Neale Hurston said of black folktales and music – hierarchies, styles, sites of social and cultural change are being made and forgotten every day.  In this world-elsewhere that is here and now, Markle’s identities as a progressive biracial and black feminist are impeccable. When speaking of her role on TV series Suits, as the biracial lawyer with a black father, she said: “Some households may never have had a black person in their house as a guest, or someone biracial. Well, now there are a lot of us on your TV and in your home with you.” And now there are even a few of us in the castles you see on TV.  How would a global marketer for the royal family describe their marriage? Charles is not going to help the royal brand become fresh and contemporary. William and Kate are contemporary royals – unpretentious, decent and likable. But they do not suggest risk or daring. Today the House of Windsor is like a venerable and all too predictable fashion house. Its cultural currency depends on history packaged as costume drama: The Queen, The Crown, The King’s Speech, Darkest Hour. To flourish it must attract new designers, new ideas and new muses. And let me end my fashion analogy by noting that in March this year, Virgil Abloh, a Ghanaian American designer, was named artistic director of menswear for Louis Vuitton, a fashion house founded in 1854 when Queen Victoria was on the throne and the royal family had yet to be rebranded as the House of Windsor.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Prince and Markle pictured at Kensington Palace in November 2017, just after their engagement was announced. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters  ¶  Perhaps a better genre through which to read the complexities of the Meghan-Harry narrative is the romantic comedy. In the best romcoms, attraction is ignited by tension and difference. Thwarted too. The characters have to learn something from each other and something about themselves; negotiate across troublesome boundaries (gender and class privilege, temperament), and learn to take emotional risks.  For this union, Harry has had to renounce his protected status as a vivaciously shallow party boy whose transgressions took the form of booze-fuelled pranks, such as showing up at a friend’s birthday party in a Nazi desert uniform with a swastika armband (the party’s theme was “colonial and native”), or hosting a game of strip poker in a Las Vegas hotel room. Reformation followed in three stages, each appealing to a different constituency. He served in Afghanistan. He recently confessed to emotional and mental health problems that began soon after his mother’s death: a shutdown of feelings, bouts of rage and anxiety followed by psychological counselling.  Finally, there came his involvement with Markle. A professional woman, an educated woman, a 36-year-old divorced American woman, a woman of colour and a feminist whose presence in his life would soon require that he forcefully denounce racism and sexism in the British press (and, I trust, among his more un-woke friends and relations). “I’ve never wanted to be a lady who lunches – I’ve always wanted to be a woman who works,” Markle once said. In show business she worked her way up. She didn’t become a Hollywood superstar; she did become a skilled, well-paid lead in a highly rated TV series. She had a social conscience, which she acted on. And now, she is more famous and more influential than she was ever likely to be on her own. It remains the way of the world. Does Amal Clooney have more resources as a human rights lawyer and philanthropist now that she is married to George Clooney? No doubt.  Once a woman enters a royal family, every aspect and function of her body becomes a site of proprietary fantasy  Whatever we think of her new job requirements, Markle will remain a working woman with a lifetime of public performances ahead. Every word, every gesture, every detail of dress will be scrutinised and read for subtext. The touches of white on her navy J Crew coat? A tribute to the British suffragettes. Bare legs instead of tights for the engagement photos? A subtle flouting of royal dress proscriptions.  Once a woman enters a royal family, every aspect and function of her body becomes a site of proprietary fantasy. The female body as a nation’s procreative destiny: the only real change through the centuries is that fantasy has replaced realpolitik. For Diana Spencer, that meant her uncle certifying her virgin status in a tabloid newspaper interview shortly after her engagement to Charles. As if his niece’s body parts were a bride price to be flaunted, eliciting leers and cheers.  For Markle, it means media warnings that she is 36 years old and shouldn’t wait much longer. “Meghan, Oh Baby! Meghan and Harry Planning a Honeymoon Knock-Up” went one headline. Her former husband, producer Trevor Engelson, is also conjuring imaginary children. He has announced plans for a Fox comedy: “Divorce is hard,” goes its pitch. “Sharing custody is harder when an ex-wife marries a British prince. Sharing custody with the British royal family in the unforgiving spotlight of London’s tabloid media is next level.”  ¶  “Meghan Markle Looks Gorgeous With Naturally Curly Hair in Childhood.” The published photo was charming, as is the video of her at 11, with a curly frizzy ponytail, chastising the ad industry for its sexism. Many of us used to ask if we’d ever see Michelle Obama in an updated version of the afro she wore in her pre-public figure days. Many of us used to answer that the furore it would cause – the afro as proof of the first lady’s secret allegiance to white-hating black militants – probably wasn’t worth the gesture. And since a small dust-up followed Meghan’s recent appearance in a bun with wavy tendrils around her face, it’s hard alas to imagine how anything, including the claim of biographer Andrew Morton that she is a direct descendant of Robert the Bruce, would atone for a full display of those racially marked curly/wavy/frizzy locks.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Markle at her aunt’s wedding. Photograph: Mail on Sunday/Solo Syndication  But if she never wears her version of a natural, she has already done race history a real service. She has helped scuttle false, foolish constructs of “the mulatto” that were developed a few centuries ago to counter the very real threat that mixed-race people posed to the constructs of white supremacy. To serve popular culture, the female mulatto became a source of social and erotic intrigue, a figure who needed strict narrative policing. Stories, novels, plays and early films gave her two options.  She could be a scheming seductress (see Lydia Brown in DW Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation, the mistress of a gullible white abolitionist played by a panting and grimacing white actress). Or she could be tragic (as in Dion Boucicault’s The Octoroon of 1859, and Charles Chesnutt’s The House Behind the Cedars of 1900), a beautiful, seemingly white woman of faultlessly refined bearing, doomed by the taint of black ancestry. The tragic version attracts the love of a well-born young white man who does not know her secret. She tries – she hopes, she longs – to pass for white, and the ruse works for a time. But, when the innocent gentleman proposes marriage, the plot dictates that her shame be revealed and she must die, by her own hand or from a fatal disease.  Decades of scholarship and memoir have corrected and complicated this narrative, of course. Still it lingers and titillates, a handy tool for condescension, suspicion and breezy sneers. A key theme in these stories is the heroine’s terror that, if she marries her white hero, she might bear a child whose skin colour would reveal the dreaded racial truth. I imagine there’s plenty of spiteful, behind-the-scenes chatter about whether this “touch of the tarbrush” will taint Meghan and Harry’s offspring. Perhaps the “blackamoor” brooch that Princess Michael of Kent was photographed wearing on her way to a royal event with Harry and Meghan was meant to signify such a dread: Meghan as the black ewe tupped by a white ram, who will produce a shamefully black offspring.  And surely the Daily Mail was gesturing towards this when it ran a story about the ostensibly tawdry origins of Markle and her mother, titled: “Harry’s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton: Gang-scarred home of her mother revealed – so will he be dropping by for tea?” Doria Ragland was cast as “a dreadlocked African American lady from the wrong side of the tracks”. One whose career as a yoga instructor and social worker suddenly made her the equivalent of the mulatta’s disreputable mother, who gathers roots and practises hoodoo.  Early rumours had it that Ragland would walk her daughter down the aisle (with her usual dreads, I hoped). Now it’s reported that Markle’s father will, or that they will share the duty. I vote for Ragland alone. Still, to watch a divorced, interracial couple walk the royal red carpet has its own rewards when, once upon a time just 51 years ago, US law forbade their marriage.  Like any black and biracial woman, she has had a lifetime of learning to both confront and navigate codes  In 2015 Markle wrote an essay for Elle in which she quite eloquently established that she is both biracial and black. She started with the blunt racial slurs of her childhood, which turned, as she grew, into the patronising queries and assumptions favoured by adults who think themselves liberal. A perfect example was the teacher who told her to fill in “white” on a census because “that’s how you look, Meghan”. Intended as a compliment, no doubt. In the essay, she also discussed the institutional racism exposed by the police shootings in Ferguson and Baltimore. She recalled the flurry of racist tweets set off when Wendell Pierce was cast as her African American father on Suits: “Ew, she’s black? I used to think she was hot.” Then, having described both her struggles with, and her pride in, being biracial, she ended the essay with a tribute to her black ancestry.  “You create the identity you want for yourself, just as my ancestors did when they were given their freedom. Because in 1865 (which is so shatteringly recent), when slavery was abolished in the United States, former slaves had to choose a name. A surname, to be exact. Perhaps the closest thing to connecting me to my ever-complex family tree, my longing to know where I come from, and the commonality that links me to my bloodline, is the choice that my great-great-great grandfather made to start anew. He chose the last name Wisdom. He drew his own box.” Excellently done, I thought. She’s refusing to let white readers white out her black identity.  When it comes to issues of race, gender, sexuality and class, how much can Meghan Markle say and do? How much does she want to say and do? We simply don’t know yet. Like any black and biracial woman, she has had a lifetime of learning to both confront and dextrously navigate codes that range from the puzzling to the vehemently punitive. Like every actress she’s had to confront misogyny. But she has options that previous generations did not.  The speech she gave at the 2015 UN women’s conference began in rousing, declamatory mode: “I am proud to be a woman and a feminist”; moved to personal narrative (this part grounded in the story of how she organised her campaign against that sexist television ad at age 11); then built up to inspirational political exhortation. “It is said that girls with dreams become women with vision. May we empower each other to carry out this vision, because it isn’t enough to simply talk about equality, one must believe in it, and it isn’t enough to believe in it, one must work for it.” May the work recommence once the £32m wedding is done.  • On Michael Jackson by Margo Jefferson is published by Granta.\n",

            "text: It's a classic  Prince George might be just 5 years old, but he’s already one of the world’s favourite royals. Why? Not only is he adorable, but he proved he’s an absolute sweetie when he comforted this crying bridesmaid at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding, and he’s also shattering gender stereotypes by taking ballet classes.  Prince William and Kate Middleton often share anecdotes about the little royal. Recently, Kate attended an event at the V&A and spoke to one of the venue’s senior curators, Martin Barnes.  According to Hello, Barnes explained to her that one of the featured photographers, William Henry Fox Talbot, ‘wanted nature to draw its own picture on the paper instead of failing with the pencil’. It struck a hilarious note with Kate as it reminded her of Prince George.  ‘She said, ‘George would do that!’ – that is blame the pencil, which was sweet,’ Barnes told the magazine.  But more recently, William decided to share which Disney film Prince George loves the most – and to be honest, same.  At a recent royal engagement, the Duke of Cambridge was asked by a little boy what TV show Prince George likes to watch.  William responded: ‘He quite likes The Lion King – he’s watched that a few times.’  Sharethrough (Mobile)  Okay, it’s not a TV show, but it’s great to know that George loves classic Disney.  But he is also a fan of animated movies, with William elaborating: ‘He has watched some Lego movies as well… trying to keep him off the television is hard work!’  Well we have to say, it sounds like Prince George has a great taste in films, which he has clearly inherited from his parents.  During an interview with BBC Radio 1, William and Kate revealed that their go-to television series is none other than Game of Thrones.  See? They’re just like us.\n",

            "text: Olivia Anderson – World Stars Mag  Meghan Markle looked sunny and chic on Thursday when she attended a reception for the Your Commonwealth Youth Challenge in London with Prince Harry.  The Duchess of Sussex wore a bright yellow sleeveless dress by American designer Brandon Maxwell, which could be considered a timely choice given the recent U.S. holiday.  The royal accessorized her look with earrings and nude heels. She also tucked her hair into a neat little bun.  The ensemble is a stark contrast to the more muted tones Meghan has been wearing since becoming a royal. However, Meghan’s wardrobe choices are likely intentional. After all, the duchess has attended many events with Queen Elizabeth II, and Dishaw suspected Meghan aligned her fashion choices for these events to not overshadow the importance of those events or the other members of her new family that were with her. As for the Duke of Sussex, Harry looked snazzy in a blue suit.  However, Meghan isn’t the first royal to wear the bright color. Kate Middleton has worn yellow to many occasions. Princess Diana also wore yellow to several events    Held at the Marlborough House, the event invited young leaders from across the Commonwealth to discuss how they hope to shape the future of their states by the year 2040. The leaders focus on a number of topics, including human rights, health climate change, peace and democracy.  Her Majesty appointed Harry Commonwealth Youth Ambassador in April 2018, so the event was a significant one for the Duke of Sussex. He expressed his excitement during a speech at the event.\n",

            "text: 1 Queen Marie Antoinette  As queen of France, Marie Antoinette became a leader of fashion – but as a 14-year-old Austrian archduchess she committed a fashion faux pas on the day she married the future King Louis XVI in the royal chapel at the Palace of Versailles in 1770.  Advertisement  Strict protocol governed wedding attire for the bride of a French heir to the throne: a cloth-of-silver dress. Unfortunately, the bride’s growing body was not taken into account when the dress was designed and so the resulting bodice was too small, meaning that Marie Antoinette’s attendants were unable to fasten the back of the gown. According to Elizabeth Seymour Percy, Duchess of Northumberland, there was “quite a broad stripe of lacing and shift quite visible, which had a bad effect between two broader stripes of diamonds [the latter of which were a gift from Marie Antoinette’s mother, Empress Maria Theresa of the Habsburg Empire].”  In addition to the ill-fitting dress, Marie Antoinette’s future hairdresser Léonard Autié considered the bride’s strawberry-blonde hair “badly arranged” for the occasion. The comment, written in his journal, may have reflected his rivalry with the hairdresser Sieur Larsenneur, who styled Marie Antoinette’s hair on the day of her wedding in a low, powdered upsweep adorned with decorative gems. Léonard opted for more elaborate hairstyles for Marie Antoinette when he later became her hairdresser.  Despite the fashion faux pas on her wedding day, queen Marie Antoinette devoted great efforts to her public image. Her milliner (hatter) Rose Bertin and hairdresser Léonard became known as the queen’s ‘Ministers of Fashion’, setting precedents for future celebrity stylists. But Marie Antoinette’s reputation for extravagance (as well as her Austrian origins) contributed to her unpopularity. The French Revolution broke out in 1789; the French monarchy was overthrown in 1792; and Marie Antoinette was executed by guillotine in 1793, a few months after her husband.  2 Queen Victoria  When Queen Victoria’s mother, Princess Victoire of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, married King George III’s fourth son – Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn – in 1818, she was dressed in an elaborate cloth-of-gold gown. This followed the tradition of Hanoverian brides, who wore court dress or royal robes on their wedding day. And when Queen Victoria’s cousin Princess Charlotte married the future Leopold I of Belgium on 2 May 1816, the bride wore a glittering ensemble of “silver lama on net, over a silver tissue slip, embroidered at the bottom with silver lama in shells and flowers”. The dress, which is the earliest British royal wedding gown that survives to this day, also boasted “manteaux [a loose sleeveless cloak or shawl]… of silver tissue lined with white satin, with a border of embroidery to answer that on the dress.”  But in 1840, for her wedding to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in St James’s Palace, the young Queen Victoria departed from Hanoverian court tradition by wearing a comparatively simple wedding dress of white silk satin trimmed with lace and orange blossoms. Victoria described her dress and jewels in her journal: “I wore a white satin dress, with a deep flounce of Honiton lace, an imitation of an old design. My jewels were my Turkish diamond necklace & earrings & dear Albert’s beautiful sapphire brooch.”  Technically, Queen Victoria was not the first royal bride to opt for white – Mary, Queen of Scots wore white on her first wedding day (when she married the future King Francois II of France, in 1558). Queen Victoria’s choice of wedding dress, however, captured the popular imagination and inspired other brides to choose white wedding dresses – a trend that continues today.  In her choice of dress, Victoria was keen to promote British industry and manufacturing during a period when English silk and lace-making were experiencing a period of decline. The silk satin was woven in Spitalfields, East London, and the lace came from Honiton and Beer in Devon. Victoria treasured her wedding lace and wore it on important occasions for the rest of her reign, including her Diamond Jubilee in 1897.  While Queen Victoria’s dress set a new trend, Victoria herself wanted to be a conventional bride by taking the same vows as other women of her time. It was asked whether she wanted to vow to obey Prince Albert and to this Victoria answered yes, because she wanted to be married as a contemporary woman, not as queen.  Modern royal brides continue to follow Victoria in showcasing British industry in their choice of wedding attire – including Catherine Middleton, who wore a dress designed by Sarah Burton for the British fashion house Alexander McQueen when she married Prince William on 29 April 2011. A statement released by Buckingham Palace shortly after the wedding read: “Miss Middleton chose British brand Alexander McQueen for the beauty of its craftsmanship and its respect for traditional workmanship and the technical construction of clothing.” The lace appliqué for the bodice and skirt was hand-made by the Royal School of Needlework, based at Hampton Court Palace, and the lace design was hand-engineered using the Carrickmacross lace-making technique, which originated in Ireland in the 1820s.  3 Queen Maud of Norway  When Princess Maud of Wales (granddaughter of Queen Victoria and the youngest daughter of the future King Edward VII) married Prince Charles of Denmark (later King Haakon VII of Norway) on 22 July 1896, she chose a comparatively simple wedding dress that did not incorporate lace. A weekly women’s magazine of the time explained to readers: “The wedding gown, made in Spitalfields, is of pure white English satin, with a long train cut in one with the skirt, and trimmed in one corner with a full bow of mousseline de soie and orange blossoms; a ruche of chiffon and flowers borders the skirt hem at the front and sides.” But Maud acknowledged the tradition for Honiton lace (set by Queen Victoria) by wearing her mother’s Honiton lace wedding veil. As royal biographer Theo Aronson (1929–2003) later observed: “Princess Maud, thanks to her mother’s unerring taste, was considerably better dressed than most royal brides.”  Maud’s trousseau [the clothes, linen and other belongings collected by a bride for her marriage] reflected her personal interests, particularly her love of cycling, riding and skiing (which she took up in Norway). Hertrousseau included riding habits and hats, and, according to a fashion magazine of the time, “A cycling-gown, which is the very model of workmanlike smartness, is of tan cloth lined with a light silk serge and faced with detachable linen collar and lapels”. The trousseau also included “for yachting, a dainty little blue serge frock”.  Maud was not the only granddaughter of Queen Victoria who opted to limit the amount of lace in her wedding ensemble. When Princess Marie of Edinburgh married the future Ferdinand I of Romania in 1893, she eschewed the traditional Honiton lace veil worn by British royal brides and chose instead a tulle veil to accompany a wedding dress selected by her mother. Later in life, as queen of Romania, Marie developed a unique sense of style, incorporating romantic interpretations of traditional folk costumes.  The simplicity of Maud’s gown has been an inspiration for subsequent royal brides. When Mette-Marit Tjessem Høiby, the current crown princess of Norway, married Crown Prince Haakon in 2001, she wore a silk crepe dress with long sleeves, a corset waist and a two-metre train. The designer, Ove Harder Finseth, is said to have been influenced by Maud’s wedding dress.      4 Princess Irina of Russia  Imperial Russian wedding dresses traditionally worn by grand duchesses were so heavy that the bride often found it difficult to move at the ceremony. Tsar Nicholas II’s cousin Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna recalled wearing “a gown of silver cloth so thick that it seemed to be made of cardboard” when she married Prince Wilhelm of Sweden in 1908.  When Nicholas’s niece Princess Irina Alexandrovna married Prince Felix Yusupov – one of the wealthiest men in Russia – at the Anichkov Palace in 1914, she decided not to wear a court dress and instead made her own choice of wedding attire. Felix wrote in his memoirs: “Irina’s wedding dress was magnificent; it was of white satin embroidered in silver, with a long train.” Irina’s veil, held in place by a tiara of rock crystal and diamonds, once belonged to Marie Antoinette. The streamlined style of Irina’s wedding dress influenced future wedding dresses right into the 1920s.  In addition to the alternative dress, the wedding of Irina and Felix featured an unconventional wedding gift as well. When Tsar Nicholas II (along with his wife, Empress Alexandra) asked Felix what he would like as a wedding present, the bridegroom requested the privilege of sitting in the Imperial box at the theatre. According to Felix, “Nicholas II laughingly agreed”. But the cordial rapport between Felix and the Tsarwas not to last. It came to an abrupt end when Felix (along with the Tsar’s cousin Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich) organised the murder of Empress Alexandra’s mystic and faith healer Rasputin at the Yusupov Palace (also known as the Moika Palace) in 1916 because they were concerned about Rasputin’s influence over the Imperial family.  Felix and Irina survived the Russian Revolution that followed and fled to the Crimea. The couple eventually settled in Paris, living there from 1920 until their deaths (Felix died in 1967 and Irina followed in 1970).  5 Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood  Princess Mary, the only daughter of King George V and Queen Mary, married Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood, at Westminster Abbey in 1922. The princess’s decision to marry an Englishman rather than a foreign prince was extremely popular. Mary’s brother Albert (the future King George VI) wrote to their eldest brother David (the future King Edward VIII): “Mary’s wedding is causing a great deal of work to many people & as far as I can make out the 28th is going to be a day of national rejoicing in every conceivable and unconceivable manner… In fact it is now no longer Mary’s wedding, but (this from the paper) it is the ‘Abbey Wedding’ or the ‘Royal Wedding’ or the ‘National Wedding’ or even ‘The People’s Wedding’ (I have heard it called) ‘of our beloved princess.’”  Princess Mary’s wedding dress design was released to the press, allowing the public to examine in detail the materials and style chosen by the princess. While previous royal brides had honoured England and sometimes Wales, Scotland and Ireland in their wedding dress motifs, Mary was the first royal bride to pay tribute to the British Empire and Dominions: the embroidery of her dress reflected the contributions of these regions to the Allied cause during the First World War. The Associated Press reported: “Princess Mary’s wedding gown is to be of cloth of silver of magnificent design. The material was bought by the Queen from India some years ago and is described as a triumph of native manufacturing.” The hand-woven ivory silk train sourced from Essex was embroidered with floral symbols from the Empire and Dominions including the maple from Canada, the lotus from India, the wattle from Australia and the fern from New Zealand.  When Meghan Markle married Prince Harry in May 2018, she honoured the Commonwealth with the floral motifs embroidered on her veil – these included the bunchberry from Canada, the kowhai from New Zealand, and, like Princess Mary, the lotus from India and the wattle from Australia.  6 Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother  Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (better known as Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother) was one of the bridesmaids at the wedding of Princess Mary, and, like her sister-in-law, she too chose to add personal touches to her wedding gown when she married the Duke of York (the future King George VI) in 1923 at Westminster Abbey.  Elizabeth’s short-sleeved ivory chiffon moire (silk) wedding dress reflected the fashion trends of the early 1920s, mimicking the dropped waist and flowing silhouette popularised by the French fashion designer Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel. The dress boasted two trains – one attached at the hips; the other at the shoulders. The veil, loaned to the bride by her future mother-in-law, Queen Mary, was made of Flanders lace. Elizabeth was pleased with her wedding ensemble, noting in her diary that “it looked lovely.”  Three other distinct characteristics of Elizabeth’s wedding gown attracted popular attention. First, the dress included a strip of Brussels Lace worn by one of the bride’s Scottish ancestors at a ball for Charles Edward Stuart, the Bonnie Prince Charlie (who in 1745 had challenged the groom’s ancestor, King George II, for the British throne). Elizabeth also incorporated spring green tulle into the accents on her own dress and those of her bridesmaids, prompting a journalist of the time to observe: “In the trimming the bride has defied all old superstitions about the unluckiness of green.” Elizabeth’s dress also incorporated a silver and rose thistle, emphasising the bride’s Scottish heritage as the daughter of the Earl and Countess of Strathmore.  While Elizabeth’s wedding gown was distinctly 1920s in style, with her bouquet she began an important royal wedding tradition that continues to the present day. In honour of her elder brother Fergus, who had been killed at the battle of Loos during the First World War, Elizabeth placed her bouquet on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Westminster Abbey. This tradition is still observed by 21st-century royal brides including Catherine Middleton and Meghan Markle.    7 Wallis Simpson, Duchess of Windsor  The wedding of the duke of Windsor (the former King Edward VIII) to Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American, at the Château de Candéin France in 1937, was one of the most controversial royal weddings of the 20th-century. The royal family boycotted the ceremony and as the woman widely blamed for the Abdication Crisis of 1936, Simpson was under no obligation to follow royal tradition in her choice of wedding attire. There was worldwide speculation about what Wallis would wear on the day.  TIME Magazine reported: “She wore a dress that most U. S. department stores were soon to feature: soft blue crepe with a tight, buttoned bodice, a halo-shaped hat of the same color, shoes and gloves to match. At her throat was a tremendous diamond-&-sapphire brooch. Mrs. Warfield carried a prayer book, had no bouquet but wore a large lavender orchid at her waist.” The colour of the dress matched the bride’s eyes and became known as ‘Wallis Blue’, prompting popular demand for dresses in this colour.  The duchess of Windsor was aware of the historical and cultural significance of her wedding dress – in 1950, she donated the dress to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Due to a defect in the dye, the dress has since faded to a cream colour, making it look like a more conventional wedding dress of the time. After her death in 1986, the duchess’s jewellery was auctioned for charity.      8 Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York  Sarah Ferguson married Queen Elizabeth II’s second son, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, at Westminster Abbey in 1986. In the design of her wedding gown, Ferguson was inspired by Norman Hartnell’s richly embroidered design for the future Queen Elizabeth II’s wedding dress in 1947. In contrast to her mother-in-law, however, the duchess chose Italian silk because it was better able to support the embroidery than English silk. She also personalised the embroidery, choosing a bee to represent her own family crest and anchors to represent Andrew’s naval career, in addition to English roses.  The duchess described her wedding dress in her memoirs: “I was inserted into my ivory wedding dress, an exquisite creation I’d lost twenty-six pounds to fit into. Lindka [Cierach] was a genius; I knew she could make the most flattering gown ever, and she had. It was amazingly boned, like a corset. We’d chosen duchess satin because it was the creamiest material in the world. It never creases. It is as smooth as glass and hangs beautifully, without a single bulge; it made my reduced figure look even better.” The dress proved cumbersome, however, when the new duchess curtsied to the queen after the ceremony and she appeared to nearly drop to the floor.  The Duke and Duchess of York separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.

            "text: Image Source: Getty / ullstein bild Dtl.  The second season of Netflix's hit series The Crown shed lots of light on Queen Elizabeth II's hapless younger sister, Princess Margaret. From her dramatic love life and nude photo scandal to her penchant for drinking and smoking, it's been made abundantly clear what most royal family aficionados knew all along: Margaret was never meant to blend in. She was always going to stand out.  Margaret was everything you'd expect a spare heir to be; much like Prince Harry and Princess Charlotte after her, she was irresistibly charming, attention-seeking, extroverted, and much more rebellious than her older sister — after all, if you don't bear the direct responsibility of one day taking the throne, you have less pressure put on you to be perfect. Margaret was only 22 when her sister became queen, and while her duties mostly consisted of representing the family on royal tours of Jamaica, Japan, Australia, and the US, she also had a vested interest in welfare charities, music, and the ballet.  After failed engagements, one divorce, two children, and a handful of extramarital affairs, Princess Margaret's royal reputation wasn't one to be desired. Throughout her later life, her health began to severely decline and the glamorous jet-set lifestyle she was known for faded away; a cigarette smoker since 15, Margaret had part of her left lung removed in 1985 (an operation similar to the one her father, King George VI, underwent three decades earlier) — and though she was able to kick the habit some years later, she continued to drink heavily. The '90s brought a bout with pneumonia, a mild stroke, and a bathroom incident — during which her feet were burned from scalding-hot bathwater — that resulted in loss of mobility to her feet.  Image Source: Getty / Tim Graham  By the early 2000s, Margaret needed help walking (and would sometimes use a wheelchair), and in January and March 2001, she suffered more strokes that inhibited her vision and paralyzed her left side. By the end of that year, Margaret would make only two official public appearances; one in August for the 101st birthday party of the Queen Mother and one in December to celebrate her aunt Princess Alice's 100th birthday.  Margaret was everything you'd expect a spare heir to be; she was irresistibly charming, attention-seeking, extroverted, and much more rebellious than her older sister.  ADVERTISEMENT  On Feb. 9, 2002, Princess Margaret died at the King Edward VII Hospital in London after suffering another stroke. She was 71. Her sister, Queen Elizabeth II, announced the news \"with great sadness\" in a statement from Buckingham Palace. A private service for family and friends was held six days later, on the 50th anniversary of her beloved father's own funeral. Margaret was cremated — a rarity for royals — and her ashes were placed in the tomb with her parents, King George VI and the Queen Mother (her mother died just seven weeks after Margaret), at Windsor Castle. In April 2002, a state memorial service was held for Margaret at Westminster Abbey. And like the unconventional badass that she was, Margaret even wrote her own epitaph, which was carved on a memorial stone.  We thank thee Lord who by thy spirit doth our faith restore  When we with worldly things commune & prayerless close our door  We lose our precious gift divine to worship and adore  Then thou our Saviour, fill our hearts to love thee evermore  As far as her legacy goes, royal biographers have posited that Margaret paved the way for future members of the family to come out on the other side after divorce. Without her public split from Earl of Snowdon in 1978 — and bearing the brunt of bad press and criticism that came with it — it may not have been as easy for her niece, Princess Anne, and nephews Charles and Andrew to go through with their own divorces (from Captain Mark Phillips, Princess Diana, and Sarah, Duchess of York, respectively).\n",

Louis was the name of Prince Phillip’s grandfather, Prince Louis Alexander of Battenberg, as well as Prince Charles’ great-uncle Earl Louis Mountbatten, who was assassinated by the IRA in 1979. Louis is also a middle name for both Prince William and Prince George.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their newborn son. Kirsty O'Connor - PA Images—PA Images via Getty Images  As for Prince Louis’ middle names, Arthur was a middle name of Queen Elizabeth’s late father King George VI and is a middle name to both William and Prince Charles. Arthur of course also brings to mind King Arthur (though experts say there’s no evidence of any actual historical king behind the famous Arthurian legends).  Prince Louis shares his third name, Charles, with his grandfather, Prince Charles.  Louis Arthur Charles is the third child for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who welcomed a son, Prince George, in 2013 and a daughter, Princess Charlotte, in 2015.  Ahead of Louis Arthur Charles’s birth, the couple announced via the official Kensington Palace Twitter account that Middleton was expecting in September 2017, but opted not to reveal the baby’s gender (something they had done with their previous two children) ahead of the birth.  The baby’s birth is just one of a series of exciting life events for the royal family this spring, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be getting married next month on May 19th.\n",

            "text: Getty  Meghan has been looking a bit peaky at the last few events.  ‘She’s usually so full of energy and very lively – but she definitely seems tired and withdrawn at the moment,’ says a source. ‘Of course, all the baby whispers would explain why she’s not herself and seems so pale.’  The exciting development comes just weeks after Meghan described being married as ‘wonderful’, before adding Harry is ‘the best husband ever’.  The news was first shared with the Queen the same day, just before Meghan boarded the train to Cheshire.  ‘It gave the Queen and Meghan a lot to talk about during their journey on the Royal Train together and there was lots of baby talk,’ reveals a source.  According to the insider, Harry has always been the Queen’s favourite and she’s taken a definite liking to Meghan – she sees a lot of herself in Meghan’s strength and tenacity.  Related: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry 'actively trying' to start a family  Related: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry reportedly 'having twins'  And to hear that they’re to be parents is exciting for Her Majesty.  ‘We haven’t seen the Queen that happy and that excited in a long time – it was wonderful to see,’ the insider revealed.  The source went on to say the mood has really continued throughout the palace since they returned. And no-one could be happier.  ‘Meghan’s still in the early stages of her pregnancy, but the palace is already working on announcements. This is the news the world has been waiting for.’  The royal couple, who are set to carry out a tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga in October, are making sure to cram in as many overseas tours as they can before Meghan is too big to travel.  ‘Harry and Meghan wanted to get a few visits in so that she could get to know the Commonwealth countries and start making a contribution to the royal family,’ revealed a source. ‘But the Queen understands that their main priority is to start a family.’  Meanwhile, royal fans in the UK have been madly placing bets on Meghan and Harry announcing their pregnancy in 2018, with Ladbrokes giving the odds a 4/6 chance.  Last month a friend close to the couple also told The Mirror: ‘They’re desperate to have a family as soon as possible’.  So keen are Harry and Meghan to have children, sources also claimed that the couple actually started trying for a baby before they got married.  Getty  Given the fact that Meghan is 36 and her biological clock is ticking, the couple didn’t want to wait to start a family.  ‘They actually stopped using protection over two months ago, although they abstained from sex in the weeks leading up to the wedding,’ a source told Hollywood Life.  And Harry previously talked about wanting kids before he even met Meghan. ‘I’ve longed for kids since I was very, very young,’ he said back in 2012.  ‘I’m waiting to find the right person. Someone who is willing to take on the job.’  In their sit-down interview with the BBC Harry expressed his desire to have children sooner rather than later: ‘We will start a family in the near future,’ he said.  Thankfully, according to royal expert Katie Nicholl, his wife is the perfect mother-to-be.  ‘Meghan is very doting with children. She is very maternal and she was thrilled to meet George and Charlotte. I think one of the lovely things that I discovered [while writing] the book was it was actually a moment involving children when Meghan really fell for Prince Harry,’ she said.

            "text: Meghan Markle may now be officially known as the Duchess of Sussex, but to her friends, she’s still just “Meg.”  Makeup artist Daniel Martin — the creative consultant for Honest Beauty, Dior Beauty brand ambassador and a longtime friend of Meghan’s who helped her achieve the perfect beauty look for her wedding day — tells PEOPLE that even he was confused as to what to call her after she was married to Prince Harry.  “I asked her that. ‘Do I bow to you? I don’t want to disrespect you, but I’ve known for almost ten years. What’s up?'” he recalls. “She started laughing and she said, ‘I’m always going to be Meg. Meg.'”  Martin added, “But next time I see them I will be respectful and know my protocol. But Meg is always going to be Meg, that’s how it is!”  Watch our full special, Meghan and Harry – a Fairy-Tale Wedding, on PeopleTV, now available on PeopleTV.com and on your favorite streaming device.  Martin says there were just five people around while prepping Meghan for her walk down the aisle: the bride, himself, hair stylist Serge Normant, dress designer Clare Waight Keller and Meghan’s mom Doria Ragland, who Martin said was “in good spirits.” The atmosphere was very relaxed, partly thanks to Meghan playing “1950s, chilled music” via Spotify.  “She didn’t seem nervous. She was very cool, she was regular Meghan,” the makeup artist shares. “I think we were nervous, but we didn’t want to make her nervous so it was very chilled. Of course, brides have nerves, but if we didn’t put so much expectation on it, it wouldn’t have made her nervous. It was very even, very easy.”  Martin added that the bride stayed off her phone as they caught up by talking about mutual friends.  Despite all their beauty work, putting on the wedding dress really made the moment feel real.  “It was all so easy. It didn’t hit us that she was getting married until she got the dress on,” Martin said.  He added, “It was so beautiful and so architectural, and when she put it on it was like a glove. It was so easy. The spectacle of the veil and the crown and it was, ‘Oh my goodness, this is really happening.’ ”  RELATED VIDEO: Harry and Meghan’s Love Story  That feeling intensified when they arrived at Windsor Castle.  “Nothing really hit any of us until we got there and we saw the people and the magnitude of everything,” he said. “The last thing we said to each other was, ‘We’ll see you on the other side.’ ”  Meghan Markle Brian Lawless - WPA Pool/Getty  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Mark R. Milan/GC Images  Martin said he got emotional when they saw Meghan after the ceremony to do touch-ups for their official portraits.  “That’s when I started crying,” he explained. “It was the first time was able to be there in person. It was almost like she looked at me and said, ‘What did you think? How’d it go?’ And I lost it.”  He continued, “It was so moving and so perfect and the day couldn’t have been better.”\n",

            "text: In a landmark moment, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and his brother, Prince Harry, have sat down for on-camera interviews to discuss the aftermath of the death of their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. The conversations will air as part of a two-hour documentary, Diana, 7 Days, which will premiere on NBC Friday, Sept. 1 at 8 p.m. ET/PT, the network announced on Thursday.  “Part of the reason why Harry and I want to do this is because we feel we owe it to her,” Prince William says in the doc. “I think an element of it is feeling like we let her down when we were younger. We couldn’t protect her. We feel we at least owe her 20 years on to stand up for her name and remind everybody of the character and person that she was. Do our duties as sons in protecting her.”  Directed by documentarian Henry Singer (9/11: The Falling Man), Diana, 7 Days examines the week between Diana’s death and her funeral. Family members, close friends, political figures, and journalists will be featured, including Tony Blair, Alastair Campbell, Earl Spencer, and Lady Sarah McCorquodale.  Princess Diana died on Aug. 31, 1997 from injuries sustained in a car crash in France, a loss that rippled throughout the world. HBO recently debuted a documentary, Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy, which focuses on her presence as a mother and was created with the blessing of her sons.  According to a press release for Diana, 7 Days, Prince William and Prince Harry will share their first reactions to the news of their mother’s death, memories of the public mourning period, their reactions on the day of the funeral, personal memories of their mother, and what she meant to them both then and now.  “When she died there was such an outpour of emotion and love which was quite shocking,” Prince Harry says in the documentary. “It was beautiful at the same time, and it was amazing now looking back at it. It was amazing that our mother had such a huge effect on so many people. When you’re that young and something like that happens to you, I think it’s lodged in here, there, wherever — in your heart, in your head, and it stays there for a very, very long time. I think it’s never going to be easy for the two of us to talk about our mother, but 20 years on seems like a good time to remind people of the difference that she made, not just to the Royal Family but also to the world.”  Diana, 7 Days is executive-produced by Alison Kirkham and Peter Dale for the BBC, and produced by Singer, Jenny Saunders, and Jessica Ludgrove.\n",

            "text: The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.  Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.\n",

            "text: Report claiming Queen Elizabeth gave Michelle Obama a \"brutal beatdown\" or that Barack Obama \"stalked\" Prince Harry on Twitter is fake news.  A fabricated story that Michelle Obama tried to “sneak a spot” on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding guest list is untrue. A blog called Just News USA claimed that Queen Elizabeth “delivered a brutal beatdown” to Michelle for trying to wormhole her way to being one of the exclusive guests at the royal wedding, which is to be held over Memorial Day weekend in 2018.  The website also alleged that Barack Obama “practically stalked” Prince Harry on Twitter, sending a message of congratulations to him “within seconds of the [engagement] news coming out,” which “perhaps had an undertone of letting the royals know that he and Michelle were available that day to attend.” It went on to claim that the former president posted a number of “desperate” tweets to Prince Harry in an effort to score a place on the guest list. The article added that the queen “royally snubbed” Barack and Michelle Obama’s attempts to attend Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding.  Gossip Cop reports that the only shred of truth to the the website’s story is that Barack’s congratulatory message to Prince Harry was soon after the wedding announcement. He wished the prince and Meghan Markle “a lifetime of joy and happiness” on Twitter. The message was in no way a massive hint to the royals that he and Michelle were “available” to attend their wedding ceremony. Just that alone is false because Harry and Meghan’s wedding date hadn’t yet been revealed until two days after their announcement.  The claims made by Just News USA that Michelle Obama tried to “sneak a spot” on the wedding guest list is largely viewed as ludicrous, especially since no other details are offered regarding Queen Elizabeth’s “beatdown” of her.  Story About Queen Elizabeth Giving Michelle Obama “Beatdown” Over Prince Harry Wedding Invite Is Made-Up https://t.co/X3FQsNnLc9 — Gossip Cop (@GossipCop) December 4, 2017  As Gossip Cop reports, if the Obamas get invited to the royal wedding, it’ll be for other reasons — such as being good friends with Prince Harry. It won’t come as a result of desperate pleas on social media. The article is characterized as “fake news” by the site that often debunks rumors and other made up stories about celebrities. The site will probably be correcting a number of inaccurate articles between now and when the royal wedding is held next year. All of the commotion about who’s going to be included on the ultra exclusive guest list will be talked about for months to come.  It’s unknown if Barack and Michelle Obama will attend Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding, but speculations suggest they’ll most likely be on the guest list. It’s currently being drafted, according to Gossip Cop.\n",

            "text: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will be tying the knot at St. George's Chapel this spring, and each and every week, ET will be breaking down all the latest updates as they gear up for their May 19 nuptials.  BIGGEST NEWS OF THE WEEK  Fans have eagerly been waiting to hear which celebrities scored an invite to what's sure to be the biggest event of the year, and this week, we learned that one of Meghan's closest pals, Priyanka Chopra, will for sure be in attendance. \"Yes I'm going,\" the Quantico star confirmed during her guest appearance on Live With Kelly and Ryan on Thursday. \"But that's all.\"  Chopra told People, however, that she is \"not a bridesmaid,\" despite all the speculation in recent months that she would be in the bridal party.  As for the groom, Prince Harry has finally picked his Best Man, and, unsurprisingly, it's Prince William! The Duke of Cambridge joked earlier this year that he was expecting to fulfill the role, but his brother had yet to ask him. We're happy to report that Harry made it official on Thursday.  \"The Duke of Cambridge is honored to have been asked, and is very much looking forward to supporting his brother at St. George’s Chapel,\" Kensington Palace shared in a statement.  Meanwhile, Meghan has been busy wrapping up all the last minute details ahead of her and Harry's nuptials. A source told ET on Tuesday that Amal Clooney's go-to hairdresser in London, Miguel Perez, is expected to style Meghan's tresses on her big day. He's currently a stylist at Salon Sloane, whose world-leading hairstylists have worked on everyone from Lindsay Lohan to the Victoria's Secret Angels.  \"Yes, I do Meghan's hair,\" Miguel reportedly told The Mail this week. \"I do Amal's, and Meghan is friends with her. I also do George [Clooney]'s, I do the whole family. Amal put Meghan and me together when she moved here [to London]. I do her color, her cut and her styling.\"  \"We have talked about it [the wedding] and we have a plan,\" he continued. \"I can't say any more, but we know what we're doing.\"  Meghan and Harry also chose the music for their wedding service this week, and it will include a full orchestra. St. George's Chapel's Director of Music, James Vivian, will direct the music, which features a selection of choral groups, soloists and musicians, Kensington Palace revealed on Tuesday.  WEDDING COUNTDOWN  So, how many days until the royal wedding? Meghan and Harry will officially be saying \"I do\" in:  Getty Images  OUT AND ABOUT  The lovebirds took a brief break from wedding planning early Wednesday morning to represent the royal family at the Anzac Day Service in London, England.  Anzac Day is a day of remembrance for soldiers from Australia and New Zealand who've served and died in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations. Both countries are a part of the Commonwealth, of which Queen Elizabeth II serves as leader.  Getty Images  ROYAL RUMOR ROUNDUP  As we anxiously wait to see what Meghan's wedding dresses will look like, there's also talks about what tiara she will be gifted with. There's a good chance that the bride-to-be will debut a brand-new tiara as she walks down the aisle, royal jewelry expert Ella Kay of the blog The Court Jeweler told Good Housekeeping earlier this week.  \"The younger son's wife getting a new tiara would be the precedent,\" she explained. \"Prince Charles might buy her a tiara.\"  Previous royal brides like Sarah, Duchess of York, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, received major bling on their wedding day. But, the circumstances are different for Kate Middleton, who wore the Cartier Halo tiara for her wedding, since she will eventually become queen, and will \"borrow\" tiaras in the meantime.  \"Usually what happens is you get allotted your tiaras,\" Kay explained. \"Like Camilla [Duchess of Cornwall] has three, but they're all technically loaners that not anyone else wears.\"  RATHER REGAL LOOKS  Getty Images  Meghan outdid herself with not one, but two regal looks in one day.  While stepping out to the Anzac Day service, the 36-year-old brunette beauty donned an elegant gray Smythe coat with a black dress underneath, Sarah Flint Jay heels, a Gucci Dionysus bag, a red poppy pin and a statement wide-brimmed, floppy hat. This type of hat is much simpler than the fancy fascinators and pillbox hats we typically see on royals like Queen Elizabeth II and the Duchess of Cambridge, but we love that Meghan put her own unique spin on the trend.  For her second look of the day, Meghan opted for a more formal ensemble. The bride-to-be arrived to Westminster Abbey in a black beret embellished with a dragonfly from milliner Philip Treacy, which she pulled off perfectly by pairing it with a midi-length Emilia Wickstead dress suit and a Jimmy Choo box clutch.  SERVIN' UP SUITS  USA Network  Sadly, this section of our weekly royals countdown ends this week, as Meghan appeared in her very last episode of Suits on Wednesday.  In case you missed it, we recapped the full finale (HERE).  You had a good run, Rachel Zane.  SPARKLE LIKE MARKLE  Earlier this week, ET caught up with one of Meghan's former makeup artists, Spencer Barnes, who opened up about her evolving beauty looks and how when he was still doing her makeup, Meghan always requested a natural look.  \"She loves beautiful skin, to start with, and she has the most gorgeous complexion,\" Barnes mused. \"It's that soft, caramel. Her mixed heritage makes her an exotic beauty of beauties. Her chocolate eyes, the way her eyes light up when she smiles, I love her smile, her teeth and her lips. And then her perfect brows.\"  \"Whenever I'd work with her, she'd like to highlight her fresh, radiant skin,\" he continued. \"We'd do a very glowing, fresh-faced skin. We'd use earthy tones, colors that enhanced her natural beauty, rather than a lot of obvious color choices, like purple, green or blue. We'd stick with earthy tones -- peaches, golds, browns -- a lot of rich, warm tones and that really flattered her. It helped her just look radiant and fresh.\"  See more in the video and in our exclusive article (HERE).

            "text: Seven years of good luck! Prince William and Duchess Kate celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary on Sunday, April 29, and Kensington Palace commemorated the occasion with an adorable photo of the couple from their wedding day.  “Seven years ago today – thank you for all the lovely messages on The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding anniversary!,” the Palace captioned an Instagram pic, which shows the then-newlyweds driving away from Buckingham Palace in a convertible.  The royal couple, who tied the knot in 2011, left their wedding reception in a blue vintage Aston Martin Volante, which belongs to the groom’s father, Prince Charles. The car was decorated by William’s best man, his brother Prince Harry and it was adorned with red heart balloons, balloons with their initials and a license plate with the words “JU5T WED.”  The pair received quite the anniversary present this year — they welcomed their third child less than a week ago. The Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to Prince Louis Arthur Charles in London on Monday, April 23. The baby, who is fifth in line to the British throne, weighed 8 pounds, 7 ounces. They are also the parents of Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 2.  As previously reported, William, 35, will act as his little brother’s best man when Harry, 33, weds Meghan Markle at Windsor Castle on May 19. Us Weekly exclusively revealed in December 2017 that Harry had asked his older brother to be his best man and Kensington Palace confirmed it on Thursday, April 26.  “Prince Harry has asked his brother The Duke of Cambridge to be his Best Man at his wedding to Ms. Meghan Markle,” the statement read. “The Duke of Cambridge is honored to have been asked, and is very much looking forward to supporting his brother at St George’s Chapel, Windsor on May 19th.”  The statement continued: “Prince Harry served as best man to The Duke of Cambridge at his wedding to Miss Catherine Middleton in 2011.”  William will have his own shot at decorating the Suits alum and Harry’s wedding car and revealing embarrassing secrets about his brother during his speech at the reception. “It feels great. I’m thrilled and delighted obviously. Revenge is sweet. I’ll be looking forward to it,” William joked at the Greenhouse Sports Centre in London on Thursday.\n",

            "text: Prince Harry pays touching tribute Princess Diana during engagement interview The couple announced their engagement after 16 months  Prince Harry and his American fiancée Meghan Markle have appeared for the first time together in a joint TV interview and paid an emotional tribute to his late mother Princess Diana. The couple, who have been together since last year and announced their engagement on the morning of 27 November, looked very much in love as they sat down with the BBC's Mishal Husain for their television appearance, and spoke about Harry's romantic proposal and their whirlwind romance.  Talking about the stunning engagement ring, Prince Harry turned conversation to his late mother in an incredibly emotional way. \"The ring is - is obviously yellow gold because that's her favourite - and the main stone itself I sourced from Botswana and the little diamonds either side are from my mother's jewellery collection to make sure that she's with us on this on this crazy journey together,\" Harry revealed.  MORE: Why Meghan and Harry are so perfect for each other  When asked what it meant to have Princess Diana's diamonds on her engagement ring, the American actress, 36, replied, \"I think everything about Harry's thoughtfulness is - and the inclusion of that and obviously not being able to meet his mom it's so important to me to - to know that she's a part of this with us. And I think in being able to meet his aunts and - and also like Julia and just different people who were so important to his mom, I'm able to, in some way, know a part of her through them and of course through him. And it's - it's incredibly special. And you know to be able to have this, which sort of links where you come from and Botswana which is important to us and it's - it's perfect.\"  Loading the player...  Harry was in no doubt as to what his beloved mother would have thought of his future wife. \"Oh, they'd be thick as thieves, without question, I think she would be over the moon, jumping up and down, you know so excited for me,\" he said, emotionally. \"But then, as I said, [they] would have probably been best friends - best friends with Meghan.\"  Harry admitted his day had been slightly bittersweet. \"It is days like - days like today when - when I really miss having her around and miss being able to share the happy news. But you know with the ring and with everything else that's going on I'm sure she's …\"  \"She's with us,\" interjected Meghan.  Harry added, \"I'm sure she's with us yeah, you know, jumping up and down somewhere else.\"  PHOTOS: Meghan Markle and Princess Diana's similarities  His comments echoed those previously made by older brother Prince William, who proposed to wife Kate in 2010 using Diana's sapphire engagement ring. Speaking during their first TV interview together, William said of his mother: “I thought it was quite nice because obviously she's not going to be around to share any of the fun and excitement of it all - this was my way of keeping her sort of close to it all.”  Kate also spoke affectionately about the late Princess, saying: “Obviously I would have loved to have met her. She’s obviously she's an inspirational woman to look up to.”  The exciting news of Harry and Meghan's engagement was revealed in a statement issued by Kensington Palace on Monday. It read: His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales is delighted to announce the engagement of Prince Harry to Ms. Meghan Markle. The wedding will take place in Spring 2018.

The Duchess travelled by car from Kensington Palace to the Lindo Wing at St. Mary’s Hospital with The Duke of Cambridge. — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) April 23, 2018  While it was rumored that she had considered a home birth for her third child, Kate will deliver the baby in the Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital in London, which has been preparing for weeks.  Not only has the outside of the wing had a new coat of paint, but parking restrictions have been in effect since April 9. Media positions went up on that date as well.  Crowds of both well-wishers and reporters are currently gathering outside the hospital, where Kate previously delivered both Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Princess Diana delivered both Prince William and Prince Harry in the hospital as well.  Regardless of whether this new child is a boy or a girl, it will be fifth in line to the throne, falling just after Princess Charlotte and just before Prince Harry.  In her previous two births, Kate had a fairly swift labor, so we could be seeing the little one in not too long. When the new royal baby does arrive, an announcement will be made both via the Kensington Palace Twitter account, and on an easel outside Buckingham Palace, but until then, let the royal baby watch begin!\n",

We should meet again.'\"  At the photo call in the Kensington Palace gardens following their engagement announcement, Harry was asked when he knew Markle was the one. He quickly replied, \"the very first time we met.\"  Things moved quickly from there.

Others speculated that if the maid of honor title didn’t fall on Kate Middleton, it would have gone to Markle’s friend Jessica Mulroney. According to Vanity Fair, Mulroney is Meghan Markle’s “secret wedding planner” and one of her best friends.  Although Markle will not have a Maid of Honor, Prince William and Kate Middleton’s children Prince George and Princess Charlotte are expected to have official roles during the ceremony. George and Charlotte were a page boy and bridesmaid at Aunt Pippa Middleton’s wedding in 2017. Newborn royal baby Prince Louis Arthur Charles is probably too young to be a page boy.

And though the news may come as a surprise to many, it seems the couple has the approval of one of the actress' famous friends: Meghan Markle.  The Duchess of Sussex is \"very excited\" for the couple, a source told E! News. \"Everyone is very happy and they are definitely a great match,\" the insider added of the duo's inner circle.  Markle herself was engaged to Prince Harry in November and tied the knot in May. Chopra, one of her longtime friends, attended both the star-studded wedding at Windsor Castle and the exclusive evening reception at Frogmore House.  If there's any chance the Duchess will attend Chopra and Jonas' rumored nuptials, she should take a note from her fellow actress' style book when it comes to wedding-guest dressing. Chopra wore a lavender Vivienne Westwood suit for the ceremony and a stunning sparkly Dior gown for the afterparty.  Though Priyanka attended the royal wedding alone, we hope Meghan goes the opposite route and brings Prince Harry when it's her turn to play wedding guest.    Jonas popped the question to Chopra last week in London around the time of her 36th birthday, People reports. The singer was so intent on finding the right engagement ring that he reportedly closed down a whole Tiffany & Co. store so he could pick one out.  Getty Images Gotham  He and the Quantico star first stepped out together for the 2017 Met Gala, but Chopra shut down romance speculation at the time. However, they sparked romance rumors again in May after fans started spotting them out together.\n",

You feel like something it's wrong with you,\" Gaga says in the video, speaking from the kitchen of her Los Angeles home.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, along with William's brother Prince Harry lead the campaign and the Gaga video was the latest in their #oktosay series, which CNN reported shows \"people from all walks of life discussing their own mental health challenges.\" Gaga says in the four-minute clip that she's a fan of the \"beautiful\" stories told in the series and was excited to share her own story about struggling with post traumatic stress disorder.  \"In my life I go, ‘Oh my goodness, look at all these beautiful wonderful things that I have, I should be so happy,’ but you can’t help it if you wake up in the morning and you are so tired and you are so sad and you are so full of anxiety that you can barely think,\" she says. Williams invited Gaga to participate after he read an open letter she issued through her Born This Way Foundation in which she revealed a sexual assault at 19 that left her with PTSD.  “It’s time that everyone speaks up and really feels very normal about mental health; it’s the same as physical health. Everybody has mental health and we shouldn’t be ashamed of it and just having a conversation with a friend or family member can really make such a difference,\" William says from a room at Kensington Palace. \"For me, the little bits that I’ve learnt so far is that it’s really important to have this conversation.

            "text: Princess Eugenie’s engagement announcement caused a right royal stir on Monday — and so did her unusual ring.  The pink padparadsha sapphire, surrounded by diamonds, is similar in style to the ruby engagement ring her dad, Prince Andrew, gave to Sarah Ferguson when he proposed in 1986.  Eugenie, 27, announced she would wed James Brooksbank this autumn in the Windsor venue that will see Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tie the knot in May.  But that doesn’t mean she’ll be overshadowed by the wedding of the year — and the price of her sparkler proves it.  The gem expert from British TV show “Posh Pawn” has estimated the value of Eugenie’s ring at $140,000 — double the estimated value of Markle’s.  The three-diamond ring that Prince Harry’s fiancee wears is estimated to be worth around $70,000.  Gemologist Deborah Papas, from Prestige Pawnbrokers, told the Sun Online: “Like her mother, the Duchess of York and indeed Princess Diana, Eugenie’s ring has a center oval precious gemstone and this one certainly has not disappointed.  “It is a padparadscha sapphire surrounded by 10 brilliant cut diamonds and two pear cut diamonds to give an edge to the standard classic cluster.  “Padparadscha is the name given to the corundum gem that bears a mixture of red and yellow, a sort of cross between a ruby and yellow sapphire.  “This beautiful gem is considered amongst the rarest and most valuable of all the corundum varieties.  “With its carefully faceted cut and the set off with the whitest of white diamonds, this ring could easily be worth over £100,000 [$140,000].  “Padparadscha sapphires are amongst the rarest and most valuable depending on quality and a little bit of difference in quality can mean a big difference in price.”  Papas admits that estimating such a valuable gem is difficult without full access but adds: “We estimate it to be in excess of £100,000 [$140,000].”  The princess has dated the 31-year-old party organizer for six years, and her parents, the Duke and Duchess of York, said they were delighted with the news.  Royal insider Dickie Arbiter revealed that the princess’s marriage to the 31-year-old would be even more star-studded than Markle’s — and the role that Sarah Ferguson would play at the nuptials.

(Photo: ALASTAIR GRANT, AP)  This week a certain royal's fashion choice made headlines for all the wrong reasons — and now she's apologizing for it.  Princess Michael of Kent, who is married to the queen's first cousin, was criticized for wearing a blackamoor brooch in front of Meghan Markle, Prince Harry's fiancé, during a Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace Wednesday.  Many deemed the brooch, which depicts an African woman, as racially insensitive as it dates back to a now criticized 18th-century art style that fetishizes slavery and people of color.

(Photo: FACUNDO ARRIZABALAGA, EPA-EFE)  In a statement to People and The Daily Mail Friday, a representative for the royal said, “The brooch was a gift and has been worn many times before. Princess Michael is very sorry and distressed that it has caused offense.”  Markle, who is set to join the royal family when she marries Harry on May 19, 2018, is of mixed race. Her mother is African-American and her father is Caucasian.  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2Bo65h8\n",

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  The actress Prince Harry looks set to pop the question to could not be more suited, say pals - because her student days were perfect training to keep up with the playboy prince.  While 36-year-old Meghan Markle may seem like the ideal princess-in-waiting, we can reveal she had a wild youth just like 32-year-old Harry.  Meghan’s days at Northwestern University in Chicago in the early 2000s have rarely been spoken about.  But a visit to her old stomping ground by the Sunday Mirror has revealed she was a typical party-loving student who allegedly used fake ID to go clubbing.  One of her favourite haunts is said to have been a bar that has since been shut down following a battle with authorities over underage drinking.  We also uncovered an article from the college news magazine in which Meghan herself joked she put on a stone after bingeing on Burger King in her Freshman year.  Interviewed by the magazine in 2014, after returning to the Northwestern campus for a Q&A session alongside fellow cast members of TV show Suits, she said: “It’s surreal because I haven’t been back since I graduated.  “And as I’m walking around I remember things like the schlep of getting to South Campus from up north.  “The 24-hour Burger King also ­definitely helped me put on the Freshman Fifteen.”  (Image: Coleman-Rayner)  Meghan attended the university’s School of Communication at the same time as fun-loving Prince Harry was getting into trouble for heavy drinking.  In his late teens, the young prince was making headlines for his wild nights out in Gloucestershire pubs around Highgrove – Prince Charles’s country home.  One pub in particular, the Rattlebone Inn, which has since changed hands, was infamous for its boozy lock-ins.  Prince Harry even set up a nightclub for his posh friends in the basement of Highgrove, calling it Club H.  And while the prince partied with his exclusive group of pals, Meghan was at college mixing with members of her own posh pack.  Hers was an all-female society, called the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, with a reputation for hard partying and social climbing.  Current KKG member Melania Hidalgo told the Sunday Mirror that Meghan had been a popular member of the student body.  (Image: Coleman-Rayner)  She said: “We’re intelligent hot messes. The thing we all have in common is that we’re all very driven, ambitious and passionate.  “Meghan was the recruitment chair of the sorority during her time here.  “She was in charge of bringing in new girls – you have to be a very friendly and outgoing person for that role.  “I lived in the house for a year and it’s a very fun experience, you end up becoming friends with people you never thought you’d mix with.  (Image: Coleman-Rayner)  “All of the late nights, and coming home from going out, watching movies… you develop very strong friendships.”  Meghan is not the only famous actor to have graduated from Northwestern. David Schwimmer, Warren Beatty, Stephen Colbert, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Zach Braff also learned their trade at the school.  Former pals told how Meghan had her eyes firmly set on Hollywood even back then – and would often sneak off for secret auditions for TV commercials.

One former student claimed: “Meghan had a fake ID during her time at university and told us about it when she visited the campus in 2014. She said she used it to drink at The Keg, which was a popular student bar for years, and she also got a job at a club in the city.  “You can get two fake IDs for about $100 in Chicago – it’s a little bit sketchy though and not everyone has one.  (Image: GC)  “She seems like the perfect modern princess now, but she lived university life like most teenagers and was really popular on campus. Everyone talks about her going here.” The Keg of Evanston later lost its liquor licence – after 36 years as a students’ favourite – following a battle with city officials over underage drinking.  It is now a trendy bar and restaurant, Bangers and Lace, and new management say The Keg will not be missed.  “It was a sh**hole, full of underage girls drinking and crazy boys starting fights,” general manager Chris Nora said. “It doesn’t surprise me Meghan had a fake ID.  (Image: WireImage)  Door staff used to joke when girls finally handed over a real one, saying, ‘It’s about time!’”  Already an accepted part of the family, Meghan is in the UK this week to give Prince Harry much-needed support on the 20th anniversary of mum Diana’s death . She spent the anniversary behind closed doors at Kensington Palace, sharing the difficult time with Harry and his brother William, along with William’s wife Kate and Harry’s nephew and niece, George, four, and Charlotte, two.  Our trip to Northwestern also shed some light on the mystery surrounding Meghan’s birth name, Rachel. For while the world knows her as Meghan, that is actually her middle name.  Rachel is the name given by her parents Thomas and Doria.  And photos discovered in the KKG house on campus show one picture of the actress captioned “Rachel Markle” – and another captioned “Meghan Markle”.  The find suggests it was during her college years that she switched her names.  And as speculation grows that the world’s most eligible bachelor could be about to pop the question, Meghan Markle is the name that will soon be known in every corner of the globe.\n",

            "text: All eyes were on Meghan Markle Saturday as she walked down the aisle — and finally revealed her dress — at her internationally anticipated wedding to Prince Harry in Windsor, England.  The 36-year-old American actress paired a Givenchy gown with a tiara from Queen Elizabeth and a 16-foot veil detailed with flowers from all 53 countries in the British Commonwealth.  Prince Harry looks at Meghan Markle, as she arrives accompanied by the Prince of Wales in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, May 19, 2018. Jonathan Brady—PA Wire  While using Givenchy, a French fashion house, was unexpected, Clare Waight Keller designed Markle’s wedding dress. The British designer was Givenchy’s first female artistic director last year, Kensington Palace announced.  Markle’s dress featured an open bateau neckline and a triple silk organza underskirt, according to Kensington Palace. And though no price has been publicly released, we do have an idea about how much custom Givenchy dresses cost: When Kim Kardashian wore one at her 2014 wedding to Kanye West, it was valued at $500,000.  Samantha Brown, a New York-based celebrity stylist, tells MONEY that although the dress may initially appear simple, the fabric and tailoring likely drove the cost up.  “The gown is exquisite in its fit, and the fabric drapes perfectly,” she says. “While it isn’t beaded or embellished, two components that always signify ‘expensive,’ the attention to detail and, of course, Givenchy price tag surely make this gown extremely lux.”  Dawn Del Russo, a fashion expert and founder of Bella Dawn, says Markle’s wedding dress has an “absolutely American princess feel.” “Haute couture gowns like this can be priced as high as $340,000,” she adds. “Safe to say her couture designer gown that will be marked in history is in the hundreds of thousands.”  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle during their wedding service, conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in Windsor, Britain, May 19, 2018. Owen Humphreys—Pool/Reuters  The ceremony caps off weeks of speculation about who would design Markle’s wedding dress, what it would look like and how much it would cost. Many of the rumors were linked to a comment Markle made about her favorite wedding gown of all time: the one Carolyn Bessette Kennedy wore at her 1996 ceremony, a slip dress the New York Times that was about $40,000 back then. Others were inspired by her Suits character, Rachel Zane. When Markle-as-Zane got married on TV, she wore a $6,800 Anne Barge creation in the Versailles style.  Similarly, the wedding dress Markle’s sister-in-law — Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge — wore when she wed Prince William in 2011 was also fiercely debated. Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding dress was the subject of much debate when she wed Prince William back in 2011. Whereas royals aficionado Katie Nicholl told Entertainment Tonight this past March that Kate’s parents paid £150,000 — about $203,000 — for the dress, the Daily Mail reported at the time that it cost £250,000 — about $338,000.  However, Nicholl did predict that Markle would avoid outdoing her sister-in-law.  “I think it was very unlikely that Meghan would spend more than that, and in doing so try and upstage a future queen,” she told ET.  But Markle didn’t have to worry about exceeding the budget of her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana. According to CBS News, Diana’s dress cost just $13,000. And Queen Elizabeth II paid for hers with coupons.\n",

            "text: Howie Mandel wasn't invited to the royal wedding — but he has no hard feelings.  In fact, he doesn't really have any feeling about Meghan Markle at all, since he doesn't even remember her from their Deal or No Deal days.  Though Meghan, 37, was a model on the game show that Howie hosted, the 63-year-old told Dr. Oz this week that he had no recollection of working with her, and it came as a surprise when he learned the Duchess of Sussex was on the show.  Nope! Howie Mandel said this week that he wasn't invited to the royal wedding  Blending in: The 63-year-old also admitted he didn't remember Meghan Markle  Rising star: Meghan worked as a 'suitcase girl' on Deal or No Deal at the start of her acting career, between 2006 and 2007  Beautiful ladies: The two definitely met, though it doesn't seem like the future Duchess made an impression on Howie  In a preview clip of an episode of The Dr. Oz Show set to air on Thursday, Howie dishes as best he can on Meghan — which is to say, he doesn't really dish at all.  'I was not invited to the wedding,' he says, answering Dr. Oz's question.  When prodding to share what he recalls of working together — Meghan was on the show briefly in the mid-2000s — Howie didn't have much to tell.  'What do I remember? I'm going to be totally honest with you. Nothing. I don't remember Meghan. I don't,' he said.  Gesturing to a photo of Meghan as a briefcase girl, Howie said, 'I saw that picture when she became the Duchess or when she got engaged.  'I saw that picture and they went, \"She was a Deal or No Deal model,\" and I go, \"Really? Really? What number?\" Then that picture, put up that picture again, as I was trying to remember, what number was she? There's no number even on her case. So, how do you know she was actually a model?  'I think she's just a young lady with a lot of baggage,' he joked.  Working the camera: The now-37-year-old was one of 26 women who had to carry a suitcase that was filled with a monetary amount, ranging between one penny and $1 million  Exciting: Her go-to briefcase number was 24, and she knew how to nail the necessary excitement for players who eliminated small dollar amounts  Surprise! Meghan appeared on the show ten years before she met Prince Harry, and said in 2013 that she did it in order to 'make ends meet' while auditioning for other roles  Meghan carried briefcases with more than one number during her time, but it was most frequently the number 24.  Speaking about her more, Howie had some generic, nice things to say.  'She's a wonderful, beautiful, young lady and I'm so happy for her. All I want for each and every person, they don't even have to be on my show to be successful and healthy,' he said.  When asked about Meghan at a Television Critics Association event in August, Howie joked that she was 'slightly duchessy' before praising all the women who held up the briefcases on the show.  'Not everybody will have the opportunity to meet royalty, but these are all accomplished people that have something substantial — they’re not just standing there holding a case,' he said.  'They have careers, they have hobbies, they have families, they’re entrepreneurial—they’re all people. So, when somebody like Harry meets somebody who just happened to be on our show, there’s a lot to offer.'  Revealed: Chrissy Teigen, 33, said she was on Deal or No Deal when Meghan was, and had only nice things to say about her  No big: Howie doesn't seem to crushed about not getting an invite  Diva?He did, however, joke that she was 'duchessy' earlier this year  'Definitely working on Deal or No Deal was a learning experience, and it helped me to understand what I would rather be doing,' she said  Meghan, meanwhile, reflected on her time on the show in a 2013 interview with Esquire.  'Definitely working on Deal or No Deal was a learning experience, and it helped me to understand what I would rather be doing,' she said, adding that it was 'in the category of things I was doing while I was auditioning to try to make ends meet.'  Some of Meghan's fellow models also had nice things to say.  'I am especially a fan of Meghan,' Chrissy Teigen told Mail on Sunday this year. 'I was on Deal or No Deal with her and she was lovely. Now everyone asks me what she was like and I say, “Sorry, no dirt. She’s gorgeous.”'  'Meghan is beautiful, smart, talented, I feel she absolutely deserves to be a princess,' former suitcase girl Aubrie Lemon told Inside Edition.  'One day she was next to me getting fitted for her dress, and the next day she's going to be the future princess,' Leyla Milani joked, before adding: 'She was always reading scripts behind the scenes when we had our down time... she was always working on her craft.'  Smile pretty: It was 'in the category of things I was doing while I was auditioning to try to make ends meet,' she said  Winner! Although she revealed that she never had the winning case, Meghan certainly knew how to put on a show while appearing on the show in a series of very provocative outfits  There she goes! At the start of each show, Meghan would have to stroll down some stairs with her fellow models, carrying a suitcase in one hand and smiling at the camera (pictured with 11)  Over on the new episode of Dr. Oz, Howie also delved into more serious issues, talking about his mental health. The comedian and entertainer has spoken out before about struggling with OCD and anxiety.  In this interview, he recalled being on the Howard Stern show 25 years ago when he started to have a panic attack.  'But the truth is, because people think because I'm a comedian they thought I was joking,' he said. 'I started having an anxiety attack, which feels like a heart attack.  'Then in my panic I said, \"Howard seriously, I go to a doctor and I have OCD. I see a psychiatrist and I feel like I'm going to die right now. You've got to please, you got to let me out.\"  Playing along: Howie also played a jokey game of Deal or No Deal with Dr. Oz, and opened up about his anxiety issues  Once Howard let him out, he realized that the show wasn't on break, and he'd set that all on air.  'I said, \"Oh, my God. I just said that publicly, on national radio.\" So number one, I thought my poor family. I outed myself as a mentally unstable person. How are my kids going to be able to go to school?  'I mean, it's going to be horrible, number one. Number two, my career is over because who's going to hire, any show cost millions of dollars. Who's going to hire somebody who has mental health issues?  'Remember this is 25 years ago and it was the darkest day of my life. I thought this is it, what do I do?'\n",

            "text: Duchess of Sussex redirects here. For the title, see Duke of Sussex  American member of the British royal family, former actress  Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (born Rachel Meghan Markle; August 4, 1981), is a retired American actress who became a member of the British royal family upon her marriage to Prince Harry.  Markle was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and is of mixed race heritage. During her studies at Northwestern University, she began playing small roles in American television series and films. From 2011 to 2017, she played Rachel Zane, on the American legal drama series Suits. An outspoken feminist, Markle has addressed issues of gender inequality, and her lifestyle website The Tig featured a column profiling influential women. She represented international charity organisations in the 2010s. She has received recognition for her fashion and style, releasing a line of clothing in 2016.  From 2011 until their divorce in 2013, Markle was married to actor and producer Trevor Engelson. In 2017, she announced her engagement to Prince Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, and moved to London. She retired from acting, closed her social media accounts, and started undertaking public engagements as part of the British royal family. She became the Duchess of Sussex on her marriage to Prince Harry in May 2018.  Early life and education [ edit ]  Rachel Meghan Markle was born on August 4, 1981, in Los Angeles, California,[1] at West Park Hospital in Canoga Park.[2] As of 2017, her mother, Doria Ragland, a social worker and yoga instructor lives in View Park–Windsor Hills, California.[1][3] Markle has often described a very close friendship with her mother.[4] Her father, Thomas Markle Sr., who lives in Rosarito, Mexico,[5][6] is a retired television director of photography and lighting director, whose profession resulted in his young daughter often visiting the set of Married...with Children.[7][8] Markle's parents divorced when she was six years old.[9][10] She has two older paternal half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jr., from whom she is reportedly estranged.[11]  Describing her heritage in a 2015 essay for Elle, Markle states that her \"dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I'm half black and half white ... While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.\"[12]  Markle grew up in Hollywood.[13] She was educated at private schools, beginning at age two at the Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse.[14][15] At age 11, her successful campaign to get Procter & Gamble to change a national television commercial she viewed as sexist was profiled by Linda Ellerbee on Nick News.[16] Though she was raised as a Protestant,[17] Markle attended Immaculate Heart High School, an all-girl Catholic private school in Los Angeles.[18] She then attended Northwestern University, where she joined Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and participated in community service and charity projects.[19][20] Markle graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 2003 with a bachelor's degree and a double major in theater and international studies.[21][22] She also served an internship at the American embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina,[22] and studied for a semester in Madrid, Spain.[20]  Acting career [ edit ]  Early in her career, Markle worked as a freelance calligrapher to support herself between acting jobs.[7] Her first on-screen appearance was a small role as a nurse in an episode of the daytime soap opera General Hospital.[23][24] Markle had small guest roles on the television shows Century City (2004), The War at Home (2006), and CSI: NY (2006).[24] She also took on several contract acting and modeling jobs, including a stint as a \"briefcase girl\" on the US game show Deal or No Deal.[7] She appeared in Fox's series Fringe as Junior Agent Amy Jessup in the first two episodes of its second season.[25] Markle had some difficulty getting roles early in her career. In 2015, she wrote: \"Being 'ethnically ambiguous', as I was pegged in the industry, meant I could audition for virtually any role ... Sadly, it didn't matter: I wasn't black enough for the black roles and I wasn't white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn't book a job.\"[26]  In July 2011, Markle joined the cast of the USA Network show Suits, playing Rachel Zane. The character began as a paralegal and eventually became an attorney. She completed work on the seventh season in late 2017.[27] According to a critique in The Irish Times, Markle deftly and \"actively re-positioned\" her character from ingenue to \"the show's moral conscience\" and gave viewers the unique portrayal of a daughter, whose African-American father is in a position to help her career and advance her \"desire to crack both racial and gender glass ceilings\".[28] She appeared in two 2010 films, Get Him to the Greek and Remember Me, and one 2011 film, Horrible Bosses.[29] She also appeared in episodes of Cuts; Love, Inc.; 90210; Knight Rider; Without a Trace; The League; and Castle.[24][30]  From 2014 to 2017, she was founder and editor-in-chief of the lifestyle website The Tig,[31][32] a name she derived from Tignanello red wine.[33] One of The Tig's features was \"Tig Talk\", a column that profiled women including Jessica Alba,[34] Gail Simmons,[35] Ella Woodward,[36] Daphne Oz,[37] Elizabeth Hurley,[38] Lauren Bush,[39] Ivanka Trump,[40] Dianna Agron[41] and Jessica Stam.[42] She closed The Tig in April 2017,[43] and in January 2018, she deleted all of her social media accounts. At the time of its closing, her Instagram account had 1.9 million followers.[44] In a statement issued by Kensington Palace, Markle thanked \"everyone who has followed her social media accounts over the years\".[45][46]  In November 2016, Markle and Canadian clothing company Reitmans released lines of women's fashion workwear and casual-wear.[47] The lines, based on her personal style, and that of her Suits character, described as \"aspirational girl next door\", quickly sold out.[44] In 2010, Markle was paid $187,000 for her role in Remember Me and $171,429 for her role in the short film The Candidate.[48] For her role on Suits, Fortune magazine estimated that Markle was paid $50,000 per episode, amounting to an annual salary of about $450,000.[49] In addition, it was estimated that as a lifestyle blogger she earned about $80,000 annually from endorsements and sponsorships.[48] In 2017, her total net worth was estimated at $5 million.[48] In 2018, she was among the nominees for the 2018 Teen Choice Awards in the category Choice Style Icon.[50]  Personal life [ edit ]  Markle began a relationship with actor and producer Trevor Engelson in 2004.[51][52] They married in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, on September 10, 2011,[53] and concluded a no-fault divorce in August 2013,[54] citing irreconcilable differences.[55] Markle's subsequent relationship with celebrity chef and restaurateur Cory Vitiello lasted almost two years, ending in May 2016.[56]  In June 2016, Markle began a relationship with Prince Harry,[57][58] who was then fifth in line to the British throne.[59] His grandmother Elizabeth II is queen of the United Kingdom and 15 other Commonwealth realms, as well as Head of the Commonwealth.[60] The couple met on a blind date set up by a mutual friend.[61] In November, the British royal family's communications secretary released an official statement that addressed a \"wave of abuse and harassment\" directed toward Markle.[62] The statement described sexism, racism and defamatory stories directed at her.[63][64][65] In September 2017, they made their first public appearance together at an official royal engagement at the Invictus Games in Toronto.[66][67]  While working on Suits, Markle lived in a rented house in the Seaton Village neighborhood of Toronto, where the show is filmed.[68] She lived in Canada for nine months each year, making a few close friends.[44] She moved out in late November 2017 after work on the seventh season had been completed.[69]  Royal marriage [ edit ]  Markle and Prince Harry attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  Markle's engagement to Prince Harry was announced on November 27, 2017 by Clarence House and Kensington Palace.[57][70] The engagement announcement prompted generally positive comment about the possible social significance of a mixed-race member of the royal family.[71] The ring Harry gave Markle was made by Cleave & Company Ltd., and consists of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from the jewellery collection of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.[72]  Following the engagement, Markle announced she would retire from acting,[73][74] and began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[75] In preparation for the wedding, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, baptized Markle and confirmed her into the Church of England on March 6, 2018.[76] The private ceremony, performed with water from the River Jordan, took place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace.[76] The marriage ceremony was held on May 19, 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[77]  The Duke and Duchess live at Nottingham Cottage in London, in the grounds of Kensington Palace.[78] They are expecting their first child, who would be seventh in line to the throne, in 2019.[79] The couple will move to Frogmore Cottage in the grounds of Windsor Castle's Home Park following the birth, but their office will continue to operate at Kensington Palace.[80][81]  Public life [ edit ]  Markle greeting the public in Belfast, March 2018  Markle accompanied Harry for the first time during an official public appearance after their engagement at a walkabout in Nottingham on December 1, 2017,[82][83] in connection with World AIDS Day.[84] The Queen invited them to celebrate Christmas with the royal family at her Sandringham estate.[85] In early 2018, Markle accompanied Harry on his engagements in Brixton,[84] Cardiff,[86] Goldsmiths' Hall,[87] and Edinburgh.[88] On February 28, Markle attended an official engagement at the first annual forum of The Royal Foundation, \"Making a Difference Together\" with the prince.[89] She became the fourth patron, alongside Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, after her marriage into the royal family.[90] Markle and Harry marked International Women's Day by attending an event in Birmingham hosted by the Stemettes.[91] Along with the Queen and other members of the royal family, she attended the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on March 12.[92] The couple made their first visit to Northern Ireland on March 23.[93] Markle carried out a total of 26 public engagements prior to the wedding.[94]  The Duchess's first official engagement after the wedding came on May 22 when she and her husband celebrated the charity work of his father, Prince Charles.[95] Her first trip abroad at the request of the British government was to Dublin, Ireland, in July.[96][97] According to a review in The Irish Times, her visit became a unique national obsession.[98]  The Duchess takes part in her husband's work as youth ambassador to the Commonwealth, which includes overseas tours.[99] The first such trip was to Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand in October 2018.[100][101] Despite the low support for the monarchy in Australia, the couple were greeted by crowds in Sydney, and the announcement of the Duchess's pregnancy hours after arrival was enthusiastically received by the public and media.[101][102]  Fashion and style [ edit ]  Markle cited Emmanuelle Alt as her style inspiration in 2017.[103][104] In an interview with Glamour, the Duchess said that she favored \"that French way of styling, where if your outfit is pulled together, then something's got to be dishevelled—your hair, your make-up\".[103] In her youth, Markle's \"sensibility had always been relaxed California girl style\" consisting of jeans, cut-offs and flip-flops.[104] She usually prefers \"streamlined dresses\" with \"neutral colors\" and boat-neck necklines,[105][106] and likes \"monochromatic and tonal dressing\".[104] She has worn outfits and ensembles by a wide variety of fashion designers.[103]  In December 2017, Markle caused a surge in interest in Scottish retailer Strathberry after carrying one of their handbags to a public event shortly after her engagement.[107][108] This was reported as an indication that her fashion choices would produce her own version of the Kate effect.[107][109] It has been speculated that Markle's effect would be greater, as she has a strong appeal in America.[109] After Markle and Prince Harry's first appearance as a couple, brands Mackage, Birks, R&R Jewelers, Crown Jewelers and Everlane noted an upswing in their website hits and sales.[110][111][108] In 2018, Tatler named her on its list of Britain's best dressed people, praising her for redefining \"modern royal style with every subsequent appearance\".[112] Following the announcement of her pregnancy, the Duchess of Sussex appeared in a Karen Gee dress which resulted in the breakdown of the designer's website.[113]  Charity work [ edit ]  Markle was a counselor for international charity One Young World. She attended its 2014 and 2016 summits.[115] At the 2014 summit in Dublin, she spoke on the topics of gender equality and modern-day slavery.[116] Also in 2014, she traveled to Afghanistan and Spain as part of the United Service Organizations Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Holiday Tour.[117][118][119]  In 2016, Markle became a global ambassador for World Vision Canada, traveling to Rwanda for the Clean Water Campaign, the agency's campaign to provide safe, clean drinking water,[120][121][26] and she traveled to India to raise awareness of issues concerning women.[122] Upon returning from India, she penned an op-ed for Time magazine concerning stigmatization of women in regard to menstrual health.[123] She has also worked with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women as an Advocate.[120][124] The Duchess is a vocal feminist and likely to use her role as a member of the royal family to continue supporting women's rights and social justice.[125]  In September 2018, the Duchess announced her support for a charity cookbook (for which she wrote the Foreword) titled Together: Our Community Cookbook.[126][127] The book, which is written by women from the Grenfell community, features recipes from around the world.[128] Meghan, who has regularly visited the Hubb Community Kitchen since January 2018,[128] said in a statement: \"Through this charitable endeavour, the proceeds will allow the kitchen to thrive and keep the global spirit of community alive.\"[126]  In 2018, Time magazine included Markle on its list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World, and placed her on its shortlist for Person of the Year.[129][130][131] She was also chosen as one of the most influential women in the United Kingdom by Vogue magazine.[132]  Titles, styles, and arms [ edit ]  Titles and styles [ edit ]  Royal monogram  Upon her marriage to Prince Harry, Meghan Markle became a princess of the United Kingdom entitled to the style of Royal Highness, as well as Duchess of Sussex, Countess of Dumbarton and Baroness Kilkeel.[133][134] She is styled as \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex\",[135] and she is the first person to hold that title.[136]  Arms [ edit ]  Ancestry [ edit ]  On her mother's side, the Duchess of Sussex is descended from African Americans enslaved in Georgia,[140] and on her father's side from German,[141] English,[142] and Irish settlers.[143] One of her possible forefathers, Heinrich Martin Merckel, emigrated to the United States from Lampertsloch, an historically German-speaking town in Alsace, and later changed the spelling of his name to Markle.[141] Among her father's distant ancestors are Captain Christopher Hussey, King Robert I of Scotland, Sir Philip Wentworth, and Edward III of England.[144][145]  Filmography [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]  Film [ edit ]  References [ edit ]\n",

There will reportedly be \"beefed up\" security at his school, St. Thomas's Battersea, and more officers will accompany him and his grandmother, Carole Middleton (Kate's mom), during their outings together.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Two weeks ago, an alleged supporter of the Islamic State group went on trial in London, accused of encouraging attacks on the four-year-old prince. Prosecutors said Husnain Rashid—a 32-year-old former mosque teacher in northwest England—provided an \"e-toolkit for terrorism\" and encouraged attacks on a range of targets, including \"injecting poison into supermarket ice creams and targeting Prince George at his first school.\"  The Guardian reports that one of Rashid's posts included a photo of George, his school, and the message, \"Even the royal family will not be left alone.\" Last week, after previously saying he did nothing wrong, Rashid admitted to a number of terror offenses, including encouraging terrorism, according to CNN.  Getty Images  Prince George—the eldest child of Prince William and Kate Middleton, and third in line for the throne—was recently seen at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding on May 19, where he served as a page boy. He was more recently spotted with his mother and sister, Princess Charlotte, for an outing in Norfolk, England, last week.  According to TMZ, Prince George's next appearance will be at Trooping the Colour on Sunday with the rest of the royal family at Buckingham Palace. As expected, there'll be a \"bigger security presence than usual,\" according to the site.  The royal family is choosing not to lay low or retreat in the wake of the ISIS threat, a source close to the family told TMZ.  Additional reporting from Associated Press.\n",

            "text: Meghan Markle experienced a roller coaster this week as the newlywed continued to navigate her new life with Prince Harry in the British Royal Family.  Recently, the Inquisitr reported that Meghan Markle took over a royal duty for Queen Elizabeth II later this year when the Queen will step back from responsibilities in the Queen’s Young Leaders program, and Markle will join her husband, Prince Harry in welcoming the young leaders in the program to Buckingham Palace.  Earlier this week, according to an Express report, the 36-year-old Duchess of Sussex joined the Duke of Sussex and the Queen at Buckingham Palace for the Queen’s Young Leader Awards. Markle hit the ground running with her royal engagements after her mid-May royal wedding, and by the looks of their fun giggles at recent events, she and Queen Elizabeth II get along famously.  However, the major faux pas that the new Duchess committed at the Queen’s Young Leader awards that made headlines was her crossing her legs over her knees instead of using the so-called “Duchess Slant,” which involves crossing her legs at the ankles instead of the knees. If that wasn’t enough, though, now another supposed break in royal protocol has come to light. Markle attempted to reach for Prince Harry’s hand as they walked behind the Queen.  null  In a video of the event, Markle, who wore a beautiful Prada dress in pale pink with her hair softly down around her shoulders, reached out to take her new husband’s hand. Instead of taking the Duchess’s hand, the Duke actually pulled his arms in closer to his sides and clasped them in front of him. After the rebuff, the two continued to walk on as if nothing out of the ordinary occurred.  Indeed, as a newlywed, it makes sense to reach out to hold hands when walking especially in stressful situations, but for some reason, the Royal Family does not do that very often. The Queen herself rarely holds her husband, Prince Philip’s, hand during official public engagements, and that seems to set the tone for the family as a whole in their interactions with the public.  Although Prince Harry and Meghan Markle often hold hands, they may not be participating in official royal family engagements when they do so. The new Duke and Duchess of Sussex appear quite affectionate towards each other in their body language. Every move Markle makes right now receives an incredible amount of scrutiny, and this hand-holding rebuff merely is one more of those profoundly analyzed details.\n",

His dad, Prince Charles, also joked about William's hair during William and Kate's wedding breakfast. In a speech, he said: \"The thing about growing older is that your children get taller than you so they can see your bald spots.

            "text: Meghan Markle is set to marry Prince Harry on May 19, 2018. Life as she knows it will forever change from that day forward. Although, since announcing their engagement, life has already changed plenty for the humanitarian and (former) actress. Between her first royal engagement with Harry and spending Christmas with the royal family,Meghan has had to make some significant adjustments to her life and the way she interacts with the public.  Below, in no particular order, a list of things Meghan probably won’t be doing once she officially becomes a Duchess.  1. Take selfies.  Meghan has already mastered this rule.During her first official event with Prince Harry in early December, Meghan reportedly told a couple who asked for a selfie, “We’re not allowed to do selfies.”  Meghan is learning the royal ropes already, telling one couple who asked for a selfie in Nottingham today: “We’re not allowed to do selfies.” — Victoria Murphy (@QueenVicMirror) December 1, 2017  Meghan also probably won’t be allowed to use any social media filters (like the puppy one from Snapchat, above) in public, and she can also say goodbye to posing with pretty drinks, unless it’s for an official royal appearance.  On top of all this, Queen Elizabeth allegedly isn’t a fan of the selfie. In 2014, U.S. ambassador Matthew Barzun told Tatler magazine that The Queen confided in him and revealed that selfies were “disconcerting” and “strange” to her. To put it another way, “She was essentially saying: ‘I miss eye contact,’” Barzun said. (via Hello!)  Related article: The Greatest Royal Family Moments To Relive From 2017  2. Go out in public totally alone.  Summer-summer-summertiiiiiime… ☀️ A post shared by Meghan Markle (@meghanmarkle) on May 28, 2016 at 11:11am PDT  Have you ever seen the Duchess of Cambridge all by herself? Like every member of the royal family, Meghan will likely have security with her everywhere she goes.  3. Give autographs.  Save for official signings at royal engagements, members of the royal family are not allowed to sign autographs for the public.The fear is that someone could forge the signature and use it against the family. In 2010, Prince Charles broke this protocol when he granted an autograph to one of the victims of the Cornwall floods. According to The Telegraph, he wrote, “Charles 2010” and apologized for his “shaky writing.”  4. Use social media.  Meghan will likely join Harry, Kate, and Will under @KensingtonRoyal on social media. The trio have been providing updates about the charities they support on the account, which has provided an intimate but controlled line of communication between the young royals and the public. @KensingtonRoyal is where Meghan and Harry released their official engagement photos in December and also where they announced their wedding date.  5. Show PDA.  There’s a reason photos of Kate and Will kissing are limited to their wedding day smooch on the balcony at Buckingham Palace. Does this mean that Meghan and Harry’s engagement photos will be the last time we see them get up close and personal? According to royal etiquette expert Myka Meier (via People), there is no official protocol against PDA, despite Meghan and Harry’s predecessors keeping things to a minimum. (Recall Kate and Will’s hug fest during the 2010 Olympics in London.) Says Meier, “Meghan and Prince Harry holding hands at a royal engagement is a refreshingly modern approach to their new role both as a couple and as representative of the royal family.” FYI, Kate and Will held hands during their Christmas morning walk to church in December 2017, while Meghan held onto Harry’s arm. But that’s probably all we’ll get moving forward.  Related article: How Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Will Make A Living After The Wedding  6. Vote.  Meghan, who will seek British citizenship after her marriage to Harry, will likely not participate in future UK elections. As the official parliament website states: “Although not prohibited by law, it is considered unconstitutional for the Monarch to vote in an election,” referring to Queen Elizabeth II. Beyond The Queen, the law is blurry, but a spokesperson from Buckingham Palace told Newsweek in June 2017 that members of the royal family do not exercise their voting rights “by convention.”  7. Wear see-through outfits like the $75,000 Ralph & Russo mesh dress in Meghan’s engagement photos.  While there was no obvious cleavage or slip-up, the sheer look of the dress raised some eyebrows and will likely be the last see-through dress Meghan wears in public or in official photos. She also drew (unnecessary) attention when she stepped out without stockings the day she and Harry announced their engagement.  “You never see a royal without their nude stockings,” royal expert Victoria Arbiter tells Business Insider. “Meghan, from what I can see from the engagement photographs, it doesn’t look like she was wearing tights or stockings. I would say that’s really the only hard, steadfast rule in terms of what the Queen requires.”  8. Wear colorful or dark nail polish.  As per royal protocol, only nails bearing natural colors are allowed at official events.According to nail polish giant Essie, Queen Elizabeth has been a customer of “Ballet Slippers,” a very subtle light shade of pink, since 1989.  Related article: 6 Major Ways Meghan Markle Has Already Broken Royal Convention  9. Wear wedges.  This rule reportedly only applies when Queen Elizabeth is present. In 2015, a source told Vanity Fair, “The Queen isn’t a fan of wedged shoes. She really doesn’t like them and it’s well known among the women in the family.” Wedge away, Meghan, just as Kate has when the Queen’s not around.  10. Stick her tongue out.  There’s a reason tongue wagging has only been displayed by the youngest members of the family, and even those instances are rare. Though, to go with her recent string of breaking royal tradition, Meghan stuck her tongue out while walking to church on Christmas with the royal family.  11. Carry giant purses.  Yes, it’s very convenient when your giant bag can fit everything from a laptop to three days’ worth of snacks. But when you’re a royal, other people carry things for you, right?  While it’s unclear whether or not carrying clutches (instead of big purses) is an official royal rule, there’s a really good reason why Duchess Kate and The Queen are almost always seen with clutches or bags with small handles. As one royal expert explained to The Daily Mail, “The Duchess of Cambridge may well prefer not to shake hands with certain people – but there are other ways to achieve this, as used by The Queen and other members of the royal family, than opting for a clutch over a bag with a strap.” What’s more: “It is protocol that you do not extend your hand to any member of the royal family… unless their hand extends first.”  Princess Diana was also a fan of clutches in the ‘80s and ‘90s, but it had less to do with etiquette or protocol and more to do with practicality. She called them “cleavage bags,” according to designer Anya Hindmarch, whose bags were a favorite of Diana’s. In 2009, Hindmarch told The Telegraph: “We used to laugh when we designed what she called her ‘cleavage bags,’ little satin clutches which she would cover her cleavage with when she stepped out of cars.”\n",

            "text: Getty  According to the publication bombshell report, both duchesses, 36, are preparing to raise the royal cousins as part of 'one big, happy family.'  An insider said, 'Kate and Meghan bonded over the men they married. Now they're bonding over being pregnant together.'  While the pregnancies are the subject of plenty of palace buzz, In Touch reveals the duchesses have only shared the news with close family and friends.  For Meghan, the US publication claims the pregnancy is not just a huge joy but an 'enormous relief.'  'She was a nervous wreck about conceiving,' a palace insider says, not only because of her age but 'because it didn't happen with her first husband,' producer Trevor Engelson, from whom she split in 2013 after two years of marriage and nine years as a couple.  In Touch  The pressure to give husband, Prince Harry, children 'felt like a huge weight on Meghan's shoulders,' says the source.  'Everyone expected her to get pregnant immediately.'  Meanwhile Prince William, 36, was 'initially shocked when Kate told him he's going to be a dad again', but now he sees it as a 'happy surprise.'  'He and Kate have always wanted four kids,' the source tells.  And this time around, adds the source, Kate gets to share her pregnancy journey with not only her young sister Pippa, 34, who is due with her first child in a few months, but her new sister-in-law, too.

Fitness enthusiast Meghan, whose mother Doria Ragland is a yoga instructor, is returning the favour by teaching Kate pregnancy yoga.  The publication adds that the two pregnant women are happily letting their husbands dote on them.

'He brings Kate tea and cookies in bed,' including lavender biscuits which are known to help with nausea.  Getty  Kate, adds the source, is 'convinced she's having another girl because she's having the same cravings for sweets that she did when she was pregnant with Charlotte.'  Meghan is hoping for one of each - a boy and a girl - the insider tells In Touch.  'This is a dream come true for both couples.'  The royal family is yet to respond to In Touch's report.

            "text: They both looked so happy, and so relaxed. They were beaming as they said their vows, and luckily, no one came forward to provide any reason that they might not be married. (This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.)  It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud.  It somehow looked charming and just right.  The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring.  There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry.  Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life.  His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry’s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry’s life since his mother’s death had finally lifted.  It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: “Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity.  Photo  Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle’s dress.  It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train.  It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped.  This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence.  At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job).  The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations.  Video  And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller’s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue.  And the After-Party Dress  The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion. The duchess wore a second dress by designer Stella McCartney. You can read our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman’s reaction here.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  A good time was had by all (even before the cocktails).  Photo  Unlike a lot of weddings — and certainly unlike Kate and William’s wedding, just seven years ago — the guests inside hung out in the aisles, air-kissing and gossiping. It’s a great royal-and-celebrity cocktail party! (Sadly without cocktails.)  Kate and William’s wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good.  But this looked totally fun for the guests — even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards — because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters.  Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps the royal family, has changed in the last few years.  Another reason, of course, is that Harry, being the second son and not a future king, has the freedom to be more relaxed, less constrained by tradition, and less conventional than his brother. This wedding has nothing to do with dynasty, or ensuring the security of the royal line. (We hope they have kids! But only because it’s fun to have kids, not because it would be some sort of international crisis if they did not.)  This wedding had everything to do with two people who are totally into each other and wanted to have a great big happy celebration.  Oprah, Beckhams and Clooneys, oh my!  Photo  One of the great excitements about any wedding, of course, is the moment you learn who has been invited and who has not. Meghan and Harry’s list was kept secret, until the very moment that dozens of mysterious figures started to enter St. George’s Chapel.  It was very exciting. There was none other than Oprah Winfrey, in a snug pink dress, a pair of very cool sunglasses and a massive broad-brimmed hat spectacularly festooned with flowers. If anyone qualifies as American royalty, it is surely Oprah, with her ability to transcend race and background, and her great gift for openness and emotional candor.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Kate Middleton’s parents, Carole and Michael, were there. They have always done such a good job of wearing appropriate outfits, smiling tastefully and saying nothing.  There was Charles Spencer, the Earl of Althorp, Diana’s brother, perhaps known best for his active love life and his impassioned attack on the British media after his sister’s death.  It turned into Celebrity Central. George and Amal Clooney made their stately, Hollywood-y entrance (She was in yellow with an interesting train).  David and Victoria Beckham, a.k.a. Posh and Becks, came in and graced some people in the crowd with their conversation.  From an American bishop, an extraordinary speech.  Photo  For many people, the most striking thing was the sermon by the charismatic Bishop Curry, who preached a ringing message of love — with references to Martin Luther King Jr. and to the legacy of American slavery — with such joy and such enthusiasm that it was impossible not to feel joyful and enthusiastic right alongside him.  “Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm, for love is as strong as death; passion as fierce as the grave. It’s flashes of fire, of raging flame. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it out.” — Bishop Michael Curry.  It was as if a Southern Baptist preacher had suddenly wandered onto the set of “Downton Abbey.”  The speech began trending on Twitter, with people marveling at the spectacle of seeing such a man saying such things in such a place.  While reporters in the British press corps struggled to render the bishop’s remark that “we gotta get y’all married” (the BBC rendered it “you all”), they also pronounced themselves thrilled — and in a completely unironic way, which does not always come naturally to them.  “If Pippa was the unexpected star of Kate’s wedding, Michael Curry is the star of this one,” tweeted Fraser Nelson, editor of the conservative-leaning Spectator, which is about as tradition-bound as they come. “Wonderful, wonderful sermon,” he added.  Monica Drake, an assistant managing editor at The Times, writes that Bishop Curry’s address was a nod to Ms. Markle’s heritage.

He was almost entirely kidding.  “Harry, what does it take?” he asked.  Different people had different reasons for coming.  Denise Crawford, who was raised in Jamaica, traveled from her home in Brooklyn to attend a wedding she considered a historic event.  “One of the children of slaves is marrying a royal whose forerunners sanctioned slavery,” she said. “The lion is lying down with the lamb.”  Alexa Koppenberg had come from Germany because she didn’t trust her web browser. It crashed when she watched the 2011 wedding of William and Kate.  “I think it’s great that she’s half African-American,” she said of Meghan Markle. “I never thought it would happen, as Harry always dated blondes before.”  A TV takeaway: Get off the red carpet.  Photo  Margaret Lyons, one of our television critics, checks in from New York with a sense of how things played out on the air.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Red carpet coverage for awards shows, particularly the Oscars, is strained, frequently sexist and often cringe-worthy — yet it persists. But if the varied and even decent live coverage of the royal wedding has anything to teach us, it’s that moving off the red carpet is the way to go.  Three hours of breathless coverage before an event even starts is … a lot.  Starting at 4 a.m. Eastern, every major outlet and several minor ones began broadcasting, but because no one was interviewing the actual high-profile guests, there was a lot less fawning.  Instead, the BBC broadcast had a brief discussion of the value of poetry with George the Poet (who, yes, is a poet). There were explanations of heraldic iconography, and interviews with people who run charities supported by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.  The American networks were also largely genial, discussing floral design, Princess Diana, naves and what defines a “morning suit.” Everyone gushed about celebrity guests and Oprah’s early arrival.  Talking about fashion is fun and interesting when the people talking about it are fashion experts, not just celebrities. If there’s a lesson here, it’s this: The shift to a color commentary model, from the current locker-room interview one, is something all red-carpet coverage should embrace.  Welcome to Windsor (you probably should have stayed home).  Photo  Anyone who found themselves in England on Saturday and thought about hopping on a train and heading to Windsor at the last minute came to a quick conclusion: bad idea.  First, there were the eager royal fans who, having arrived perhaps days earlier, had already snagged all the good spots along the procession route.  That was in addition to the thousands of police officers, some on horses, with their sniffer dogs, their metal fencing, their vehicle recognition technology, their closed-circuit TV cameras, their helicopters and their marine patrols of the river.

More than 100,000 people were crowded into the little town today. No one is saying how much the security operation cost, but the current (unconfirmed) estimate is that it will come to as much as 30 million pounds.  That’s about $40 million, with the bill to be paid by British taxpayers.\n",

Frank Augstein/AP  After the royal wedding on May 19, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will jet off for their honeymoon — and according to Travel + Leisure, the destination of choice is Namibia, in South West Africa.  Neighboring Botswana, which the couple most recently visited for Markle's 36th birthday celebration, Namibia offers incredible views and ultimate privacy.  To find out what a honeymoon itinerary in Namibia may look like, Business Insider talked to Marisa Lassman, a travel expert and founder of Another Africa, a luxury travel agency that specializes in unique and tailored trips across the continent.  \"We go to great lengths to profile our clients and understand their interests, travel preferences, and requirements,\" Lassman told Business Insider. \"No two itineraries are ever the same.\" Lassman also noted the best time of year to visit Namibia is in May. With the royal couple and their tastes in mind, she drafted an eight-day itinerary for their honeymoon.  From horseback riding, to private tours led by a wildlife documentary filmmaker, to witnessing stunning views of the Skeleton Coast, see how the royals could be spending their time together in Namibia.\n",

            "text: What happens when a prince interviews a president? Well, if this teaser of Britain’s Prince Harry interviewing former US president Barack Obama is anything to go by, the answer is a lot of fun.  On Prince Harry’s request, Barack Obama agreed to star in a guest edition of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Kensington Palace shared the trailer on Sunday,where Harry can be seen joking with Obama.  In the preview, Obama asks Harry if he has to speak quickly, since he is a slow speaker. “Do I need a British accent?” jokes Obama.  In turn, Harry tells the former president that if he takes long pauses between answers, he will get “the face”.  “Let me see the face”, asks Obama, leading Prince Harry to pull an exaggerated mock-grimace. “I don’t want to see that face,” the former president says.  Here is a sneak preview of when @BarackObama met Prince Harry for the interview. Listen to the full interview on 27th December on @BBCr4today. pic.twitter.com/p5I1dUdyhx — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) December 17, 2017  The trailer also shows Prince Harry saying that while Obama is excited, he is feeling nervous. “I’ll interview you if you want,” says Obama. “Let’s keep it this way, I’d much prefer that,” replies Harry.  Harry and Obama are known for their rapport and their very public exchanges of sassy banter. Who can forget the British royal’s Twitter ‘war’ with the Obamas while promoting the 2015 Invictus Games, which lead to Harry’s by-now-famous ‘mic drop’ moment? Not even the Queen.  Invictus Games is a Paralympic sporting event for injured or sick armed forces personnel, that was found by Prince Harry in 2014.  Harry and Obama hung out at this year’s Invictus Games in Toronto in September, joking, cheering and taking selfies with fans. Social media gushed over the bromance, spinning memes around it.  The full 40-minute interview will air December 27 on England’s BBC Radio 4 Today.  First Published: Dec 18, 2017 12:23 IST\n",

            "text: It’s official! On Tuesday, USA Network officially announced that original Suits cast member Meghan Markle is leaving the legal drama at the end of season 7. The word arrives a day after news broke of her engagement to Prince Harry of Wales.  This certainly doesn’t come as a surprise. Two weeks ago, it was reported that she and fellow original cast member Patrick J. Adams would depart once their contracts were up at the end of the upcoming season, and Markle noted in her joint interview with Prince Harry that she was leaving acting behind. There is no word yet if Adams will remain past season 7.  For the past seven seasons, Markle played the tenacious Rachel Zane, an ambitious paralegal who eventually became a full fledged lawyer at the show’s central law firm. Along the way, Rachel began dating and eventually got engaged to the firm’s wonder-boy, Mike Ross (Adams).  USA Network and Universal Cable Productions released the following statement: “From all of us at USA Network and Universal Cable Productions, we want to send our most heartfelt congratulations to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry on their engagement. Meghan has been a member of our family for seven years and it has been a joy to work with her. We want to thank her for her undeniable passion and dedication to Suits, and we wish her the very best.”  The seventh season of Suits will resume in 2018.\n",

            "text: Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall rang in her 70th birthday on July 17, so what better time to look at one of the most important relationships in her life? The connection that she has with her two high-profile stepsons, Prince William and Prince Harry, is one that has evolved from some very dark times into something that those around them likely doubted they would ever see. By the time William and Harry were born, their father, Prince Charles, had not only long ago ended his relationship with Camilla, but he didn't see her socially as a friend, either. Charles and Camilla had been romantically involved in their early 20s, but Charles's naval career took him away to sea, and he ended the relationship. Camilla married her ex-boyfriend Andrew Parker-Bowles, and Charles wrote to his godfather, \"I suppose the feeling of emptiness will pass eventually.\"  The pair initially remained friends and lived near each other. The Parker-Bowles were regular visitors to Charles's country home Highgrove, and Charles was made godfather to their son Tom. When Charles and Diana got engaged, he stopped seeing Camilla socially, and so William and Harry never met her as young boys — but they certainly heard about her. When Charles and Diana's marriage broke down and they both sought affection elsewhere, Diana made her feelings about Camilla clear to her sons and so followed years of William and Harry's anger toward the woman Diana called \"Charles's lady.\"  Charles and Diana separated in 1992, and after five years, he made moves to introduce his sons to the woman he hoped would one day be his wife. In the Summer of 1997, Charles sat down with William and Harry, explained a little about their relationship, and broached the subject of them all meeting — but William especially was resistant, and Charles knew it would be best to leave it for the time being.  \"Diana made her feelings about Camilla clear to her sons and so followed years of William and Harry's anger towards the woman Diana called 'Charles's lady.'  Diana died two months later, which naturally meant for Charles that it was all about supporting his sons. Over the next year, Charles and Camilla kept their relationship low-key; it was easier to work on building the relationship between Camilla and the queen.  Over time, the princes could see that Camilla made their father happy. At the age of 16, William took charge of the inevitable and finally instigated a meeting in June 1998 at the London residence he and Harry lived at with their father, York House at St James's Palace. They spoke on their own for half an hour, and it was reported that it went well, but that afterward, Camilla came out and said \"I need a drink.\" They went on to meet for lunch and afternoon tea soon after and continued getting to know each other. Harry's first meeting with Camilla was more straightforward and came a couple of weeks later, over tea at Highgrove along with her children, Tom and Laura.  Over the next seven years, the relationship between Camilla, William, and Harry was built very slowly. When the boys organized a 50th birthday party for Charles in November 1998, they invited Camilla to sit with Charles, although their relationship at that point was still very tentative. Camilla started to stay over at York House when William and Harry were in town, but when they were all at Highgrove together, she would drive back to her own house nearby after dinner, out of respect for the fact that it used to be Diana's house, too.  By the time Charles and Camilla married in 2005, things were significantly better between the two boys and Camilla. Shortly afterward, Harry said in an interview, \"She's a wonderful woman, and she's made our father very, very happy, which is the most important thing. William and I love her to bits.\" A further 12 years on from the wedding, and the brothers have now developed a warm, respectful, and loving relationship with their stepmother. It's telling that Camilla's granddaughter Eliza Lopes was a bridesmaid at William and Kate's wedding, and Harry even brought along a toy for her to play with. Camilla and Kate are also close. When Kate got married, Camilla gave her a special bracelet inscribed with both of their initials and has been best-placed to guide her through the ups and downs of marrying into one of the most famous families in the world.\n",

Each week in April, Vanity Fair will flash back to a different British royal wedding in the lead-up to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s May 19 nuptials.  When Prince William proposed to Kate Middleton in 2010, he presented her with his mother’s own engagement ring—a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire surrounded by 14 round diamonds that Princess Diana had picked out from court jeweler Garrard before her own fairy-tale wedding to Prince Charles.  “It was my way of making sure mother didn’t miss out on today and the excitement and the fact that we’re going to spend the rest of our lives together,” William told press afterward.  Even though Princess Diana was represented, from that point forward, by the iconic ring sitting on Middleton’s finger, Kate made sure in the following six months to pay tribute to “the inspirational woman” who would have been her mother-in-law. A week before the wedding, as worldwide anticipation reached a fever pitch, Kate reportedly made a special trip with William to Diana’s burial site—venturing 90 minutes’ northwest of London to the 13,000-acre Althorp Estate that has belonged to the Spencer family since the 16th century. The pair reportedly took a boat to lay flowers at Diana’s Oval Island resting place; wandered the princess’s ancestral estate; and walked through the arboretum where William and Harry planted trees as children.  “It was very important for William to take Kate to visit his mum just before their wedding day,” a source told The Mirror at the time. “Diana is still a huge part of her boy’s everyday life and always will be. Even though Kate never met Diana she knows what an incredible woman she was and it is very important to her she can share and understand William’s love and grief for his mum. . . . It is tragic that she won’t be there to see the wedding and that she never got to meet his bride.”  The tributes continued. Though William and Kate married at a different site than Charles and Diana—Charles, an architecture and music buff, had opted for the more handsome, acoustically sound St. Paul’s Cathedral—the bride and groom incorporated other homages. Like Diana, Kate had a small blue bow sewn into her wedding dress for good luck, and antique lace repurposed in the design as her “something old.” (Aside from those touches—plus the white color, long sleeves, and gauzy veil—there were few other similarities between Kate and Diana’s wedding dresses. Kate’s gown—a Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen design, rumored to cost $434,000, was an elegant A-line, with an elaborate bodice appliqué woven with shamrock, roses, and lilies, and a nine-foot train.)  Top, from Bettmann/Getty Images; bottom, by Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images.  Both Diana and Kate wore drop earrings from their parents—Diana’s earrings featured 50 small diamonds around pear-shaped pearls, which had belonged to her mother, while Kate’s were commissioned by her parents to include elements from the Middleton coat of arms. Both brides also wore a tiara, though Diana wore the Spencer tiara—a diamond floral diadem dating back to the Tudor period. (It has been rumored that Meghan Markle might wear the tiara as a nod to Princess Diana on her wedding day.) Kate, meanwhile, borrowed Queen Elizabeth II’s Cartier Halo Scroll Tiara—which had been gifted to the monarch on her 18th birthday.  Inside Westminster Abbey on the morning of April 29, 2011, there were more nods to Diana. When Prince William arrived at the Abbey, with best man Prince Harry in tow, the first person the groom greeted was Diana’s eldest sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale—“clutching her hands affectionately” in the minutes before the ceremony, according to The Telegraph. The Spencer family—including Diana’s brother Earl Spencer—had been given a front-row pew at the Abbey, and William welcomed them all warmly. Time additionally reported that McCorquodale was wearing the very earrings that Diana wore during her 1981 vows—which had been flown in from a museum where they were on display specifically for the occasion.  The wedding address was delivered by Richard Chartres, the Bishop of London who had served as a trustee of Princess Diana’s will and presided over the princess’s funeral. William and Kate chose the hymn “Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer”—which was the final selection sung at Diana’s funeral. As for the guest list, William made sure to invite Elton John, his late mother’s friend who famously performed at Diana’s funeral—which also took place at Westminster Abbey.  Top, by Anwar Hussein/Getty Images; bottom, by Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images.  Speaking about the uncanniness of being present at Westminster Abbey for both Diana’s funeral and William’s wedding, Elton John told press, “I can’t imagine at that young age having to walk in the public, following your mother’s coffin. . . . And the next time we’re in the Abbey it’s to see him walking up the aisle with a beautiful woman, the love of his life. I think it’s the most joyous result and I’m sure Diana would be very, very happy about it.”  Elton conceded that he had only met William and Harry twice, but was touched by the symbolic invitation: “I think it’s going to be a very joyous day and I think [Diana] would be very happy with his choice, [Kate] seems such a great girl and they seem so much in love.”  In a nod to Diana’s charitable spirit, William also invited representatives from organizations Diana championed—like Centrepoint, a homelessness charity, and the Royal Marsden Hospital—and asked that, in lieu of gifts, well-wishers make donations to a fund that would be divided between 26 organizations.  Top, from Princess Diana Archive/Getty Images; bottom, by Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images.  The newlyweds departed Westminster Abbey to the sounds of William Walton’s orchestral march “Crown Imperial”—which was similarly played at Charles and Diana’s wedding. As the bells rang a full peal, William and Kate boarded the open-top 1902 State Landau carriage—the same vehicle that transported Charles and Diana back to Buckingham Palace after their own wedding—and took a similar route, waving their way through London’s adoring crowds. Once back at Buckingham Palace, bride and groom made an appearance on the balcony. When the crowd urged William to kiss his bride—just as Charles had done in 1981, in a rare break from royal-wedding tradition—William happily obliged.  Later that evening, when Prince Harry gave his best-man speech at an intimate Buckingham Palace reception, he reportedly told his older brother, “Our mother would be so proud of you.”  Wedding Breakfast  After the wedding, Queen Elizabeth hosted approximately 650 people for a luncheon reception at Buckingham Palace—where she served miniature Yorkshire puddings with beef, Cornish-crab salad on lemon blini bites, and Scottish smoked salmon. In addition to a traditional fruitcake, Prince William had specially requested a chocolate biscuit cake, made from a royal-family recipe. When the couple left, they did so in Prince Charles’s Aston Martin—which Prince Harry had customized with balloons and a “JU5T WED” license plate.  Wedding Gifts  Though Kate and William asked well-wishers for charitable donations, the couple still received traditional gifts—including their cocker spaniel Lupo (a gift from Kate’s brother James Middleton); a tandem bike (from London mayor Boris Johnson); and a cover of Stevie Wonder’s 1972 ballad “You and I” specifically recorded by George Michael for the occasion.  Reception Revelry  The day was capped with an intimate reception at Buckingham Palace, with a three-course meal prepared by Prince Charles’s favorite chef Anton Mosimann: crab layered with fresh langouistine, followed by herb-stuffed Welsh lamb, and a dessert of chocolate mousse, honeycomb ice cream and traditional sherry trifle. Kate had changed into a strapless evening dress with a diamanté sash, and angora-wool bolero, while William had swapped his Irish Guards dress for a tuxedo. Each table was reportedly named after a town or city special to the couple—like St. Andrews, where the couple met.  “Just before midnight,” according to Vanity Fair’s report from Katie Nicholl, “Harry announced, ‘We have a little surprise,’ and led guests through to the Throne Room, which had been transformed into a nightclub complete with mirrored balls, sofas, and cocktails. The bride and groom were the first to take to the dance floor, to a rendition of Elton John’s ‘Your Song’ by Ellie Goulding, whom they had specifically requested for the evening. . . . Then it was time for the real fun to begin. The disco kicked into full swing, and [Kate’s mother] Carole [Middleton], dazzling in a floor-length black chiffon gown, was one of the last ones dancing to her requested song, Jermaine Stewart’s ‘We Don’t Have to Take Our Clothes Off.’ Around 2:30 a.m., guests were asked to make their way to the courtyard for a fireworks display.”\n",

REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque  You can't say he wasn't warned.  Last week, former royal butler Grant Harrold spoke to ITV News about all the ways Trump could offend the Queen on his controversial visit to the UK.  One piece of advice was to always let the Queen take the lead when walking around — but it would seem the tip fell on deaf ears.  In a truly cringe-worthy viral clip, President Trump is seen breaking etiquette by walking in front of the Queen and then blocking her off when he stops, forcing Her Majesty to manoeuvre around him.  This breach of royal protocol led to outrage on Twitter as people called out the president for his lack of awareness.  Trump was visiting Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle (where Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were married) and took afternoon tea with the royal after they inspected the Coldstream Guards.  In an interview for The Daily Mail that took place on Air Force One, Trump raved about his meeting with the Queen: \"The Queen is fantastic!  \"She's a fantastic woman; so much energy and smart and sharp. She was amazing! Such a wonderful lady and so beautiful! It was such an honour to finally meet her. To have a Queen like that is great.\"  Although Trump was apparently happy to meet with the matriarch, many in the UK were not.  100,000 protestors flooded London's Trafalgar Square to object to the president's visit.  According to CBS, it was the largest weekday protest the city has seen in 15 years.\n",

They detailed everything from how Harry got down on one knee to why Meghan didn't let him finish the big question. USA TODAY  In this photo taken from video Britain's Prince Harry and Meghan Markle talk about their engagement during an interview in London, Monday, Nov. 27, 2017. It was announced Monday that Prince Harry, fifth in line for the British throne, will marry American actress Meghan Markle in the spring, confirming months of rumors. (Photo: AP)  LONDON — People around the world — from celebrity Kim Kardashian to regular folks — rushed to congratulate Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle on their engagement Monday. But many here, where the royal family resides, reacted in British ho-hum fashion.  \"I'm happy for the geezer, but I don't care,\" John Hedge, 42, said on a street in Streatham, a mixed-income neighborhood in south London.  That low-key response, expressed by others in the British capital, matched the way Harry said he popped the big question: while they were cooking a roast chicken during a \"standard, typical night\" at their cottage on the grounds of Kensington Palace.  \"Not interested,\" said Tony Jones, a commuter rushing to a train at London's Victoria station Monday evening.  Other Britons took to social media to ask whether the engagement would mean an extra day off — it won't. \"Give us the bank holiday or else,\" wrote Owen Jones, a left-wing newspaper columnist who believes the monarchy should be abolished.  Prime Minister Theresa May's office said the wedding day — sometime in the spring — will not be a national holiday, in contrast to the 2011 nuptials of Harry's older brother and future king, Prince William and Duchess Kate.

CLOSE Tourists react to Prince Harry’s engagement Video provided by AFP Newslook  Reaction outside Buckingham Palace, a top draw for tourists worldwide, was also relatively low-key.  \"I think it's perfectly fine for her to marry into the royal family,\" said Kieran Verseim, a medical lab technician from Denver. \"Anybody should be able to chose who they want to marry regardless of background,\" she said.  Markle, who is biracial, will be the first non-white person to marry into the royal family in modern history, a fact that sparked debate about interracial marriages in the United Kingdom. About 1 in every 10 people are in racially mixed relationships in the U.K., according to the latest census data.  \"We don't know too much about the royal family in Turkey,\" said Tarik Dogan, 42, an engineer from Istanbul as he marveled at the queen's official residence.  \"The little ones, the children, they are sweet,\" he added, referring to Prince George and Princess Charlotte.  Unlike some locals, the tourism industry reacted with glee about the next royal wedding. Visit London, the official city guide, congratulated Harry and Meghan and said the royal family are \"so important for tourism in London.\"  Tourism across the U.K. linked to the royal family generates more than $666 million a year and attracts more than 2.7 million visitors, according to Visit London.

Her husband, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is expected to become king of the United Kingdom and 15 other Commonwealth realms, making Catherine a likely future queen consort.[2]  Catherine grew up in Chapel Row, a village near Newbury, Berkshire, England.[3] She studied art history in Scotland at the University of St Andrews, where she met William in 2001. Their engagement was announced in November 2010. They married on 29 April 2011 at Westminster Abbey. The Duke and Duchess's children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis of Cambridge, are third, fourth, and fifth in the line of succession to the British throne.[4][5][6][7][8]  The Duchess of Cambridge's charity works focus mainly on issues surrounding young children, addiction, and art. To encourage people to open up about their mental issues, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry initiated the mental health awareness campaign \"Heads Together\" in April 2016.[9]  The media has called Catherine's impact on British and American fashion the \"Kate Middleton effect\".[10] In 2012 and 2013, Time magazine selected her as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World.[11][12]  Early life  Catherine Elizabeth Middleton was born at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading on 9 January 1982 into an upper-middle-class family.[13][14][15][16][17] She was baptised at St Andrew's Bradfield, Berkshire, on 20 June 1982.[18][20] She is the eldest of three children born to Michael Middleton (b. 1949),[21] and his wife, Carole (née Goldsmith; b. 1955),[22] a former flight dispatcher and flight attendant, respectively, who in 1987 founded Party Pieces, a privately held mail order company that sells party supplies and decorations with an estimated worth of £30 million.[23][24][25] Her father's family has ties to British aristocracy and benefited financially from trust funds which they established over 100 years ago.[26][27][14][28] Her Middleton relatives were reported as having played host to British royalty \"as long ago as 1926\".[29][30] She has a younger sister, Pippa, and a younger brother, James.[31]  The family lived in Amman, Jordan, from May 1984 to September 1986 where her father worked for British Airways (BA). Middleton attended an English-language nursery school.[32][33] When her family returned to Berkshire in 1986, she was enrolled aged four at St Andrew's School, a private school near Pangbourne in Berkshire. She boarded part-weekly at St Andrew's in her later years.[34] She studied at Downe House School.[35] She was a boarder at Marlborough College, a co-educational independent boarding school in Wiltshire,[36][37] and graduated in 2005 from the University of St Andrews in Fife, Scotland, with an undergraduate MA (2:1 Hons) in the history of art.[38] Before university, during a gap year, she travelled to Chile to participate in a Raleigh International programme, and studied at the British Institute of Florence in Italy.[39] In November 2006, Middleton worked as an accessory buyer with the clothing chain Jigsaw,[40] where she worked part-time until November 2007. She also worked until January 2011 at the family business in catalogue design and production, marketing, and photography.[18][41] Prior to her marriage, Middleton lived in an apartment owned by her parents in Chelsea, London, which was estimated to be worth £1–1.4 million.[42] In 2018, Catherine's total net worth was estimated at £5–7.3 million, most of which is from her parents' company.[42]  Relationship with Prince William  Early relationship  In 2001, Middleton met Prince William while they were students in residence at St Salvator's Hall at the University of St Andrews.[43] She reportedly caught William's eye at a charity fashion show at the university in 2002 when she appeared on the stage wearing a see-through lace dress.[44] The couple began dating in 2003, although their relationship remained unconfirmed.[45] During their second year, Middleton shared a flat with William and two other friends.[46] On 17 October 2005, Middleton complained through her lawyer about harassment from the media, stating she had done nothing significant to warrant publicity.[47]  Middleton attended Prince William's Passing Out Parade at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst on 15 December 2006.[48][49] Media attention increased around the time of her 25th birthday in January 2007, prompting warnings from both the Prince of Wales and Prince William and from Middleton's lawyers, who threatened legal action. Two newspaper groups, News International, which publishes The Times and The Sun; and the Guardian Media Group, publishers of The Guardian, decided to refrain from publishing paparazzi photographs of her.[50]  In April 2007, Prince William and Middleton split up. The couple decided to break up during a holiday in the Swiss resort of Zermatt.[51] Newspapers speculated about the reasons for the split, although these reports relied on anonymous sources. Middleton and her family attended the Concert for Diana in July 2007 at Wembley Stadium,[46] where she and Prince William sat two rows apart. The couple were subsequently seen together in public on a number of occasions and news sources stated that they had \"rekindled their relationship\".[52] Her long-term relationship with William before the marriage earned her the nickname \"Waity Katie\" in the tabloid press.[46]  On 17 May 2008, Middleton attended the wedding of Prince William's cousin Peter Phillips to Autumn Kelly, which the prince did not attend.[53] On 19 July 2008, she was a guest at the wedding of Lady Rose Windsor and George Gilman. Prince William was away on military operations in the Caribbean, serving aboard HMS Iron Duke.[54] In 2010, Middleton pursued an invasion of privacy claim against two agencies and photographer Niraj Tanna, who took photographs of her over Christmas 2009.[55] She obtained a public apology, £5,000 in damages, and legal costs.[56]  Engagement and marriage  The newly married Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the balcony of Buckingham Palace (2011)  Prince William and Catherine Middleton became engaged in October 2010, in Kenya, during a 10-day trip to the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy to celebrate his passing the RAF helicopter search and rescue course.[57][58] Clarence House announced the engagement on 16 November 2010.[57][59] Prince William gave Middleton the engagement ring that had belonged to his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. The couple married in Westminster Abbey on 29 April 2011[60] (St. Catherine's Day), with the day declared a bank holiday in the United Kingdom. Estimates of the global audience for the wedding ranged around 300 million or more, whilst 26 million watched the event live in Britain alone.[61][62][63] On marriage, Catherine assumed the style \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge\".[64]  In October, several months after the wedding, Commonwealth leaders pledged that they would implement changes in British royal succession law to adopt absolute primogeniture, meaning the first child of the Duke and Duchess, whether male or female, would be next in line to the throne after their father.[65]  Motherhood and children  William and Catherine with their first son the day after his birth (2013)  On 3 December 2012, St James's Palace announced that the Duchess was pregnant with her first child. The announcement was made earlier in the pregnancy than is usual as she had been admitted to King Edward VII's Hospital suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness. She remained in the hospital for three days.[66][67] On 14 January 2013, St James's Palace announced that the child was due to be born in July 2013, and that the Duchess's condition was improving.[68] The Duchess was admitted to St Mary's Hospital in London in the early stages of labour on the morning of 22 July 2013 and gave birth to Prince George later that day.[4][5]  The Duchess's second pregnancy was announced on 8 September 2014.[69] As with her first pregnancy, the Duchess suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum that required her to cancel official engagements.[70] On 2 May 2015, she gave birth to Princess Charlotte.[6][71]  On 4 September 2017, the Duchess's third pregnancy was announced. She was again forced to cancel engagements due to hyperemesis gravidarum.[72] Prince Louis was born on 23 April 2018.[73]  Public life  Middleton's first public appearance with Prince William following the announcement of their engagement was at a fundraising event organised by the Teenage Cancer Trust in December 2010.[74] She was formally introduced to public life on 24 February 2011, two months before the wedding, when she and Prince William attended a lifeboat-naming ceremony in Trearddur, Anglesey, in North Wales.[75] A day later they appeared in St Andrews to launch the university's 600th anniversary celebrations.[76] In March 2011, the couple toured Belfast.[77] Their last public engagement before the wedding was a visit to Darwen Aldridge Community Academy.[78][79] On 16 February 2011, Clarence House announced the couple's first royal tour of Canada would take place in July 2011.[80] In May 2011, shortly after the wedding, Clarence House announced the Duke and Duchess would extend their tour to visit California.[81] This was to be the Duchess's first visit to the United States.[82]  Catherine and William meet the Obamas at Buckingham Palace two weeks after their wedding (2011)  The Duchess's first official engagement after the wedding came in May, when she and her husband met Barack Obama, the President of the United States, and First Lady Michelle Obama.[83] On 26 October 2011, she undertook her first solo event for In Kind Direct, stepping in for the Prince of Wales, who was in Saudi Arabia.[84] On 2 November, the Duke and Duchess visited the UNICEF Supply Division Centre for supplying food to malnourished African children in Copenhagen, Denmark.[85][86] On St. Patrick's Day, 17 March 2012, the Duchess carried out the traditional awarding of shamrocks to the Irish Guards at their base in Aldershot; this was her first solo military engagement.[87] On 19 March, she gave her first speaking engagement for the opening of the Treehouse, a new children's hospice opened by East Anglia's Children's Hospices (EACH), a charity of which she is a patron.[88]  In June 2012, The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry was renamed The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, to reflect Catherine's contribution to the charity.[89] The Duke and Duchess were announced as ambassadors for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, alongside Prince Harry.[90] As part of her role, the Duchess attended numerous sporting events throughout the games.[91] In September 2012, the Duke and Duchess embarked on a tour of Singapore, Malaysia, Tuvalu, and the Solomon Islands as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.[92] During this overseas visit, she made her first official speech abroad, while visiting a hospice in Malaysia, drawing on her experience as patron of East Anglia's Children's Hospices.[93][94]  After the birth of Prince George, the Duchess carried out her first engagement in late August when she accompanied the Duke to meet runners preparing for an ultra-marathon on the isle of Anglesey, where they had a residence.[95][96] At the beginning of March 2014, details were announced of the half-month-long tour to New Zealand and Australia that the couple and their son would be taking from 16 to 25 April.[97] The tour was Catherine's first visit to the area and Prince George's first major public appearance since his christening in October 2013.[98] The tour began in New Zealand where they visited Wellington, Blenheim, Auckland, Dunedin, Queenstown and Christchurch. It ended in Australia where they visited Sydney, the Blue Mountains, Brisbane, Uluru, Adelaide, and Canberra.[99] In June 2014, the couple visited France to attend the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Normandy landings at Gold Beach.[100]  On 21 July 2014, it was announced that the Duchess would be making her first solo trip, visiting the island of Malta on 20–21 September 2014, when the island was celebrating its 50th independence anniversary.[101] Her trip was cancelled, with the Duke taking her place, after the announcement of her second pregnancy in early September.[102] In December 2014, the couple visited the United States and attended a charity dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[103] In April 2016, the Duchess and her husband undertook a tour to India and Bhutan.[104] The Duke and Duchess toured Canada again in September 2016.[105] Countries visited by the couple in 2017 include France, Poland, Germany, and Belgium.[106][107][108][109] The Duchess also visited Luxembourg City in May 2017 for the Treaty of London commemorations.[110] In January 2018, the couple visited Sweden and Norway.[111]  Charity work  Patronages  In March 2011, the Duke and Duchess set up a gift fund held by The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry to allow well-wishers who wanted to give them a wedding gift to donate money to charities they care about instead.[112][113] The gift fund supported 26 charities of the couple's choice, incorporating the armed forces, children, the elderly, art, sport and conservation. These causes were close to their hearts and reflected the experiences, passions and values of their lives.[114][115]  The Duchess of Cambridge's charity works focus mainly on issues surrounding young children, addiction, and art.[116] She has a number of patronages: The Art Room, National Portrait Gallery, East Anglia's Children's Hospice, Action on Addiction, Place2Be, Natural History Museum, Anna Freud Centre, Sportsaid, and The 1851 Trust.[117][118][119] The Duchess, who was an art student, takes an interest in art and handpicked the Art Room, which \"helps disadvantaged children express themselves\" through art therapy, and the National Portrait Gallery.[120] In her capacity as patron of Action on Addiction, the Duchess has occasionally made visits to its centres, spending time with recovering addicts.[121] The Duchess is joint Patron of 100 Women in Hedge Fund's Philanthropic Initiatives, along with Prince William and Prince Harry.[122] She is also a local volunteer leader with the Scout Association in north Wales,[123] of which the Queen is patron, and the Duke of Kent is president.[116] It aims to provide activities to over 400,000 young people in the UK.[116]  In October 2012, the Duchess gave her royal patronage to the M-PACT programme (Moving Parents and Children Together), one of the only UK programmes to focus specifically on the impact of drug addiction on families.[124] In December 2015, she assumed the patronage of the Royal Air Force Air Cadets[125] for youths 12–19 years of age. The Duke of Edinburgh, who had been patron of the RAF Cadets for 63 years, formally handed over during an audience at Buckingham Palace.[126] In 2017, she replaced the Queen as patron of The Lawn Tennis Association,[127] All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club,[128]and Action for Children.[129]  In January 2018, locks of her hair were reportedly donated to the Little Princess Trust, a charity which makes wigs for children diagnosed with cancer.[130] In February 2018, the Duchess became the patron of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.[131][132] She also launched Nursing Now, a three-year worldwide campaign to raise awareness about the profile of nurses. She said the campaign was personal to her as both her grandmother and great-grandmother were volunteer nurses.[133][131][132][134] In March 2018, Kensington Palace announced the Duchess of Cambridge would become the first royal patron of the Victoria and Albert Museum.[135][136]  Advocating for mental health  Catherine, who has tackled issues surrounding mental health and disabilities, has made visits to charities and hospitals such as St Thomas' Hospital and Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute to spend time with mothers and children who deal with these issues.[137][138][139] To encourage people to open up about their mental health issues, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry initiated the mental health awareness campaign \"Heads Together\" in April 2016. The Duchess later voluntarily talked about her problems as a mother, and admitted that she suffered a \"lack of confidence\" and \"feelings of ignorance\" during certain periods of time.[9][137][140]  The Duchess of Cambridge also launched the Mentally Healthy Schools, a project which helps the students and staff with access \"to reliable and practical resources to improve awareness, knowledge and confidence in supporting pupils' mental health.\"[141] Benita Refson, president of Place2Be, one of Catherine's patronages, has praised the Duchess's work saying she would help \"shine the spotlight on child mental health.\"[142] In February 2016, she travelled to Edinburgh to promote the work of Place2Be, launched Children's Mental Health Week, and contributed to the HuffPost UK as a part of the Young Minds Matter movement, an effort \"to raise awareness for children's mental health issues.\"[143][144] The Duke and Duchess later met with members and representatives of Young Minds and Youthscape to promote their mental health campaign.[145] In recognition of their work with charities concerned with children's mental health, the Duchess and her husband were awarded the Gold Blue Peter badge, an award previously granted to the Queen.[146] During a speech at the Royal Foundation forum in 2018, the Duchess said she would continue her work to raise awareness for mental health and said that \"The mental health of children and adults is one area where a long-term view will make all the difference to future generations.\"[147]  Public image and style  Middleton, prominent for her fashion style, has been placed on numerous \"best dressed\" lists.[148][149] The Daily Telegraph selected her as the Most Promising Newcomer on its 2006 list of style winners and losers.[150] Tatler placed her at number eight on its yearly list of the top ten style icons in 2007.[151] People featured her on its 2007 and 2010 best-dressed lists.[152] Middleton was named one of Richard Blackwell's ten Fabulous Fashion Independents of 2007.[153] In June 2008, Style.com selected her as its monthly beauty icon.[154] In July 2008, Vanity Fair included her on its international best-dressed list.[155] In February 2011 the Global Language Monitor named her the Top Fashion buzzword of the 2011 season.[156] In January 2012, the Headwear Association voted her Headwear Person of the Year.[157] Middleton was number one on Vanity Fair's annual best dressed lists in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013; she also appeared as the cover star in 2012.[158] The Duchess was named to the International Best Dressed Hall of Fame List in 2014.[159] In 2014, she was already being regarded as a British cultural icon, with young adults from abroad naming her among a group of people who they most associated with UK culture. These included: William Shakespeare, Queen Elizabeth II, David Beckham, J. K. Rowling, The Beatles, Charlie Chaplin, Elton John and Adele.[160][161] In June 2016, she took part in her first magazine shoot for Vogue's centenary issue appearing on the cover.[162]  The \"Kate Middleton effect\"[10][163] is the trend that the Duchess is reported to have had on others in sales of particular products. While Catherine wears items from many new designers, she has also worn dresses by Catherine Walker, who designed many of Diana's favourite evening gowns and day suits.[164] She has worn outfits, hats and ensembles by many other fashion designers.[165][166] The brands she favours are noted in the media.[165][166]  The Duchess, who attended the 71st British Academy Film Awards, did not participate in Time's Up movement calling for women to wear black on the red carpet.[167] Royal protocol forbids members of the royal family from taking part in political movements but she wore a black sash and carried a black handbag as a variation to the informal black dress code.[168][169] In March 2018, together with the Countess of Wessex, the Duchess hosted the Commonwealth Fashion Exchange reception at Buckingham Palace during 2018 London Fashion Week.[170][171]  Privacy and the media  The death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in Paris while being chased by paparazzi in 1997,[172] influenced the Duke's attitude towards the media.[173] The Duchess and her husband have asked that, when off-duty, their privacy should be respected,[173] but the media has not always respected with their wishes.  In 2009, before her engagement to William, Middleton was awarded £10,000 damages and an apology from the photographic press agency Rex Features Ltd. after she was photographed playing tennis on Christmas Eve while on holiday in Cornwall.[174]  In September 2012, the French edition of Closer and the Italian gossip magazine Chi, published photographs of the Duchess sun-bathing topless while on holiday at the Château d'Autet[173] (a private château on a 260-ha estate 71 km[175] north of Aix-en-Provence). Analysts from The Times believed the photographs were taken from the D22 (Vaucluse) road half a kilometre from the pool—a distance that would require an 800-mm or a 1000-mm lens.[176] On 17 September 2012, the Duke and Duchess filed a criminal complaint with the French prosecution department and launched a claim for civil damages at the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Nanterre.[177] The following day the courts granted an injunction against Closer prohibiting further publication of the photographs and announced a criminal investigation would be initiated.[178] Under French law, punitive damages cannot be awarded[179] but intrusions of privacy are a criminal offence carrying a maximum jail sentence of one year and a fine of up to €45,000 for individuals and €225,000 for companies.[180][181] In September 2017, Closer was fined €100,000 and its editor Laurence Pieau and owner Ernesto Mauri were each fined €45,000.[182]  In December 2012, two Australian radio hosts, Michael Christian and Mel Greig, called King Edward VII's Hospital Sister Agnes where the Duchess was an in-patient for hyperemesis gravidarum. Pretending to be the Queen and the Prince of Wales, Greig and Christian spoke to a nurse on the Duchess's ward, enquiring about her condition. Following a hospital inquiry and a public backlash against the hoax, Jacintha Saldanha, the nurse who put the call through to the ward, committed suicide.[183] The radio hosts subsequently apologised for their actions.[184]  In February 2013, Chi published the first photos of Catherine's exposed baby bump, taken during her vacation on the private island of Mustique. The British press refused to publish the paparazzi shots.[185] While the Duchess was visiting the Blue Mountains in Sydney, a picture was taken of her bare bottom as her dress blew up. Many newspapers outside the UK published the picture.[186]  On 14 August 2015, Kensington Palace published a letter detailing what it stated were the \"dangerous\" and invasive efforts of the media to get paparazzi pictures of Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Jason Knauf, communications secretary to the Cambridges, wrote the letter to media standards organisations in various countries.[187]  Titles, styles, honours and arms  Titles and styles  Royal monogram  Catherine is, by marriage, a princess of the United Kingdom and entitled to the style of Royal Highness.[188] She is usually styled as \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge\".[189] When in Scotland, she is referred to as the Countess of Strathearn.[190] Northern Ireland is represented by a third title, Lady Carrickfergus.[189][a]  Honours  Medals  Commonwealth honours  Honorary military appointments  5 July 2011 – present: Canadian Ranger  Honorific eponym  Awards  Arms  In September 2013, the Queen granted a conjugal coat of arms to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, consisting of their individual arms displayed side by side, beneath a helm and coronet denoting the duke's status as grandson of the sovereign.[196] Below is shown the earlier grant of the duchess's personal arms, impaled with those of her husband.  Ancestry  The Duchess of Cambridge's father, Michael, and her paternal ancestors were from Leeds, Yorkshire. Her paternal great-grandmother, Olive, was a member of the Lupton family, who are described in the City of Leeds Archives as \"landed gentry, a political and business dynasty\"; previously unpublished pictures revealed in March 2015 that Olive Middleton had grown up on her family's Potternewton Hall Estate alongside her cousin, Baroness von Schunck (née Kate Lupton).[31][200][201][202][203] Catherine's paternal ancestors also include her great-great-grandfather, politician Francis Martineau Lupton (1848–1921), whose first cousin, Sir Thomas Martineau, was the uncle of World War II Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.[204]  The Duchess's maternal ancestors, the Harrisons, were working-class labourers and miners from Sunderland and County Durham.[205] Ancestors through her maternal line include Sir Thomas Conyers, 9th Baronet (1731–1810), who was a descendant of King Edward IV through his illegitimate daughter Elizabeth Plantagenet.[206] Other ancestors are Sir Thomas Fairfax (1475–1520) and his wife Anne Gascoigne, who was a descendant of King Edward III.[207][208]  Notes  ^ Even with the title Lady Carrickfergus, she is still mostly referred to as the Duchess of Cambridge in Northern Ireland, as per given sources.

            "text: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” meaning that whatever she wears more or less sells out immediately across the globe. Some designer labels she has worn have had to double their staff just to keep up with demand after a photo of her in a particular outfit is published.  LONDON, ENGLAND - JUNE 17: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge look out from the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the Trooping the Colour parade on June 17, 2017 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  Her two older children, Prince George, 4, who is third in line for the throne, and Princess Charlotte, 2, also produce the “Prince George Effect” and the “Princess Charlotte Effect.” According to Brand Finance, Princess Charlotte could spur as much as $5 billion boost to the economy, with Prince George creating a slightly smaller economic impact, estimated to be around $3.6 billion. Their third royal baby could generate up to $1 billion for the British economy.  Correction: This article originally misstated Prince William dukedom. He and Kate Middleton are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, not the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall.\n",

            "text: On Saturday, Prince Harry, 33, and Meghan Markle, 36, will wed at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle in a ceremony officiated by . . . sorry, we almost fell asleep there. We know all those details. You know what’s much more fun to discuss than wedding logistics? Wedding drama.  And unlike many royal weddings, there has been no shortage of it, especially in the last week. Here’s all the gossip leading up to the year’s most anticipated nuptials:  What’s up with Meghan’s dad?  Thomas Markle Sr., 73, used to work as a TV lighting director and cinematographer and has since retired to Mexico. Much has been made of Meghan’s relationship with her dad, as he and her mom divorced when Meghan was 6. Thomas has never met Harry, but they’ve reportedly spoken by phone. An “insider” recently told People magazine, “Like any father-daughter relationship, there have been ups and downs over the years. But they are in a good place now.”  Then it gets confusing. In early May, Meghan’s half-brother (more about him later) sent a nasty letter to Harry, imploring him not to marry Meghan and calling it “the biggest mistake in wedding history.” The letter, obtained by In Touch magazine, claimed Meghan’s father had not received an invitation to the wedding. However, the palace released a statement at the time confirming that Thomas would walk his daughter down the aisle. So that was weird.  However, things fell apart this week when it was revealed that Thomas Sr. had been working with the paparazzi to stage photos of himself: Reading a book on Great Britain, getting fitted for a suit, etc. This did not go over well, as the palace had chastised the media for badgering him. On Monday, Thomas told TMZ that he regretted the photos, saying they were “stupid and hammy,” and said he would not be attending the wedding because of a recent heart attack. A day later, he changed his mind and said he would love to go. Then, he contacted TMZ once more to say that he had to undergo heart surgery on Wednesday, and he would officially not be attending.  Early in the week, the palace sidestepped commenting on this mess, as a spokesperson simply said, “This is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation.”  On Thursday, Markle finally weighed in: “Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.”  And what’s up with her half-sister?  Samantha Markle, 53, is Thomas Sr.’s daughter from his first marriage and lives in Florida with her three kids. She made headlines early in Meghan and Harry’s relationship when it was reported she was penning a tell-all memoir called “The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister.” (The two reportedly haven’t spoken in years.) Samantha also trashed her half-sister in interviews, calling her a “shallow social climber” only interested in fame. Later, she changed her tune, saying Meghan was “absolutely lovely.”  So guess who wasn’t invited to the wedding? Plus, Samantha admitted this week she was the one who persuaded their father to take those staged pictures, thinking it would help improve his image. This earned her a dressing-down from TV host Piers Morgan, who called her a “little vulture.”  Why did Meghan’s half-brother write such a cruel letter to Harry?  It’s unclear — maybe Thomas Jr., 50 (Thomas Sr.’s son from his first marriage) was upset that he was left off the wedding guest list? “Meghan Markle is obviously not the right woman for you,” he wrote to Harry, adding his half-sister was a “jaded, shallow, conceited woman that will make a joke of you and the royal family heritage.” Thomas Jr. later appeared to regret this, as he gave a follow-up letter to In Touch in which he begged Meghan for a wedding invitation, trying to guilt her with the line, “We are all still family.” We’re guessing that it did not work.  However, Thomas Jr.’s ex-wife, Tracy, and their sons, Tyler and Thomas, did not let that deter them — they recently landed in London, where they’ll be acting as wedding correspondents for “Good Morning Britain.”    Meghan Markle watches the closing ceremonies of the Invictus Games with her mother, Doria Ragland, in Toronto last year. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press/AP)  What about her mom?    Doria Ragland, 61, is a yoga instructor and social worker. Meghan is her only child, and they’re extremely close. Before the engagement, she met Harry, who proclaimed her “amazing.” Tabloids reported that Doria, who lives in Los Angeles, recently quit her job at a mental health clinic. (Hmmm, could she be moving out of the country sometime in the future?) It has been speculated that Doria could walk her daughter down the aisle. (Update: Prince Charles is actually going to do it.) Either way, she arrived in London earlier this week to spend time with Meghan and meet the royal family.  Is her ex-husband really producing a TV show based on their relationship?  Meghan married film producer Trevor Engelson in 2011; they split two years later. In September 2017, Deadline reported that Engelson was shopping a fictional TV comedy with the description: “Divorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London’s tabloid media, is next level.” Hmmm. The idea was apparently sparked when Engelson and another producer were talking about what could have happened if he and Meghan had kids.  However, the Sun recently reported that Engelson, after being persuaded by Meghan and some mutual friends, has put the project on hold — for now.  Is there any drama on Harry’s side of the family?  Have you seen “The Crown”? You have? Good. That’s probably all the intense Windsor drama you’re going to get. Because Harry and Meghan limited the size of their guest list — it still includes 600 people, so everyone can chill — some distant relatives who were invited to William’s wedding were not invited to Harry’s. The royals are trained in remaining tight-lipped about most drama, of course, so we don’t know whether these minor snubs have caused any problems.  What’s up with those rumors about Meghan and Kate feuding?  Meghan’s eloquence and openness have earned her comparisons to Harry’s late mother, Princess Diana, often called the “People’s Princess.” Several tabloids report Kate is jealous of this comparison and Meghan’s overall popularity with the family and public.  But some rumors are simply rumors, friends, as Meghan and Kate have shown no signs of fighting — in public, at least. They both attended a Royal Foundation event with their significant others in February, during which the foursome were asked whether they ever disagree.  William replied, “Ohhh, yes,” according to Vanity Fair. Harry elaborated: “I think it’s really good we have got four different personalities and we all have that same passion to make a difference. We have different opinions and they work really well [together].” He then noted that they are all “stuck together for the rest of our lives,” to which Meghan added, “Togetherness at its finest.”    Prince Harry, Meghan Markle and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, attend the first annual Royal Foundation Forum. (Chris Jackson/AFP/Getty Images)  What roles will William and Kate have in the wedding?  A few months after William said his younger brother had not yet asked him to be his best man — “It could be a sensitive subject,” he joked on a radio show — Kensington Palace announced that William would, in fact, return the favor that Harry did for him in 2011. Kate probably won’t have a formal role during the ceremony, according to a Vanity Fair source who said Meghan and Harry “just want Kate to be able to enjoy the day and not worry about anything.” William and Kate’s older children, George and Charlotte, will be in the wedding party, while young Louis will stay at home.  [Little royals George and Charlotte threaten to upstage everyone else at Uncle Harry’s wedding]  Are Harry’s exes invited to the wedding?  Probably! Harry is said to be on good terms with Cressida Bonas, whom he dated for two years, and Chelsy Davy, whom he dated on-and-off for seven. There’s also precedent: Several of William’s exes attended his wedding, and Prince Charles’s then-ex-girlfriend — now his wife, Duchess Camilla — attended his to Diana.  Which celebrities will be there?  Never forget that before she ascended to royalty, Meghan was a mere Hollywood celebrity. Several actors from “Suits,” the USA network legal drama that propelled her to fame, are expected to attend the ceremony: Gabriel Macht, Patrick J. Adams, Sarah Rafferty, Gina Torres and Rick Hoffman. All five Spice Girls — British royalty in their own right — likely will, too, along with Meghan’s pals Priyanka Chopra and Serena Williams. Despite their friendship with Harry, Barack and Michelle Obama will not be present.

            "text: The rumour: Meghan Markle had a secret first husband  Where you heard it: The National Enquirer  The report: Markle’s status as divorcée has never been in dispute, but according to a new “bombshell” Enquirer cover story (is there any other kind?), Prince Harry will be the ex-actress’s third kick at the matrimonial can. “How she HID PAST from Husband No. 2!” claims one scandalous cover line, referring to “Man-eater Meghan’s” ex Trevor Engelson. Inside, an unnamed source explains how Harry was “blindsided” by the news, which has been kept secret until now (per the NE), thanks to a “hush-hush annulment.”  Subscribe To Our Newsletters — And Get All Our Royal Coverage Straight To Your Inbox  The smell test: For the love of Liverpool — this stinks worse than the royal stables after derby day! Just for starters, if Meghan had been married before she married Trevor Engelson in 2011, why would she have felt the need to hide it? Back then she was a Hollywood actress, existing in a world where divorce is no biggie. It’s not like she could have been planning for her royal future (yes, MM may be calculated, but she’s not clairvoyant). And even if we run with this idea of a secret ex-hubby (whom The Enquirer never names, btw), wouldn’t we already know about him? For his recent book Meghan Markle: A Hollywood Princess, royal biographer Andrew Morton spoke to dozens of people who knew Markle long before she was one half of a commemorative plate design. So we’re supposed to believe that not one of them would have mentioned old what’s-his-name? Never mind the fact that even “hush-hush annulments” are a matter of public record. The Enquirer’s insider speculates that MI-5 (a.k.a. her Majesty’s Secret Service) probably “scrubbed the records” to conceal Markle’s past, which is totally something that MI-5 would try to do. Except that unless they have a time machine, this is a story with way too many loose ends. In summation: Either Meghan Markle does not have a secret first husband (smart money), or she does, and anyone who knows about it better sleep with one eye open.  The rumour: The Palace is freaking out about the steamy love scenes in the upcoming Meghan and Harry Lifetime movie  Where you heard it: Vanity Fair  The report: In case you are not already counting down the days, Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance is the upcoming Lifetime movie that depicts the couple’s courtship, including (per this preview), some between-the-sheets time, and one scene-stealing giraffe. It’s that first part that purportedly has the palace press office in a tizzy. “What I’ve heard is that they’re seriously worried about the sex scene,” the movie’s director, Menhaj Huda, told VF last week, adding that his info is on good authority, as his “wife’s best friend has been dating the palace press secretary.”  The smell test: What really reeks here is Huda’s indiscretion. Whatever insider info he did or did not receive via his wife’s connection, you can be sure he won’t be hearing anything else in the future. (Jeez, dude — it’s called protecting your source.) Is the palace “seriously worried” about this movie? It’s easy to see why Huda would want us to think that, since scandal sells. In truth, it’s probably a matter of relativity. Because sure, they’d probably prefer that a factually based account of Harry and Meghan’s premarital sex-fest wasn’t coming soon to a TV near you, but it’s not like it’s a documentary. On the scale of royal scandal — a 1 being Kate Middleton’s cork wedges and a 10 being Prince Charles’s tampon ambitions — this is a 2.  The rumour: Meghan’s mom Doria will tell all in an interview with Oprah  Where you heard it: The Mirror  The report: Last week, The Daily Mail reported that Markle’s mom visited Winfrey’s Santa Barbara Estate, where she stayed for six hours, and exited with gifts (presumably a bunch of the Big O’s favourite things). At the time, the reason for the visit was unknown, but now The Mirror is quoting an unnamed “US TV source,” who claims that the pair were brainstorming ideas for a TV appearance (well, duh). Apparently both women are keen to discuss the reaction to Meghan and Harry through the lens of racism: “It’s an issue close to both Oprah and Doria,” quoth The Mirror’s source, adding that the only thing needed now is a green light from Buckingham Palace.  Rumour Has It That Meghan Markle And Kate Middleton ‘Hate Each Other’s Guts.’ Is That Really The Case?  The smell test: Not to nitpick here, but can an interview really be a “tell-all” if the palace has to approve it? Historically, the royal family has espoused more of a “tell-none” approach to the media. Oprah (who has interviewed pretty much everyone on the planet) never sat down with Diana or Charles or Queen Lizzie herself. That said, Markle is at the forefront of a whole new era, particularly when it comes to royals and the public. Both Harry and Wills have done interviews recently, discussing personal details about their own mental health, and clearly the Queen approved those. Given that Doria has thus far kept her mouth shut (unlike many members of the Markle clan who have made a full-time job of trashing their world-famous relation in the press), it’s possible a (highly scripted) sit-down with Winfrey will be her well-earned reward.  The rumour: Prince Harry will wear a wedding ring  Where you heard it: E! News  The report: This will-he-or-won’t-he drama has been ongoing since the engagement announcement, but now a source is telling E! that the Royal Ginger Snap “does want to wear a wedding band.” Improbably, this is one matter that is not covered in the royal etiquette handbook, and is instead a matter of personal preference: The Queen’s husband Prince Philip does not wear a ring (no big surprise there), and neither does William, while is father, Prince Charles, does.  The smell test: The idea that there is no existing protocol on the subject of male finger bling is hard to fathom, but if that’s the case, this all smells pretty sound. E! has proven to have some pretty well-placed royal sources. Meghan’s feminism could mean that she believes rings are for both genders. And Harry is definitely more a jewellery guy than super-traditional Wills. If royal memory serves, he and Meghan wore matching bracelets even before they went public as a couple.\n",

            "text: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been dating since 2016, and most of the relationship was formed over a long distance. So now that they've made things official and are about to get married, it's fair to wonder if Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are living together now or if royal protocol has kept them under different roofs. The answer is not all that surprising.  When the couple first met, Suits was still filming in Toronto, which is where Meghan was posted up. To visit each other, the couple had to carry out an elaborate bait and switch plan to distract the paparazzi and keep their romance a secret, according to Us Weekly. Meghan would travel to London for events and they took vacations together, but it wasn't until late 2016 that the The Sun reported they were \"virtually inseparable\" and that Markle had \"practically moved in\" with Harry. By that time, the couple had made their relationship public.  An anonymous source also told the outlet, \"They’ve taken things to the next level. They’re practically living together. She cooks for him, he pops out to the gym and they’re just enjoying hanging out.\" For those who might be scandalized by the young couple living together before marriage, it's actually a lot more common than some might think -- even accounting for royal protocol.  A source told HollywoodLife last year, \"The royal family has had to move with the times in order to survive, and they are nowhere near as stuffy and old fashioned as they used to be. Prince William and Kate Middleton lived together before marrying, so it’s no shocker that Harry and Meghan plan to do the same.\"  WPA Pool/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Right now, they're living in Nottingham Cottage, a 1,300 square foot house on the Kensington Palace compound, according to People. Ken Wharfe, a former police protection officer for the family, told the outlet that it's a \"lovely, classic Victorian cottage.\"  He added that it's \"not very big, incredibly small,\" which is understandable by royal standards. Wharfe elaborated that the cottage, one of just a few at Kensington Palace, was originally used for estate staff, but in the past few decades has been occupied by family members. He added of the properties:  They are well restored, typical country cottages and originally used for the estate workers. In the past 40 years or so they’ve been accommodation for senior members of the household. They’ll be updated but there certainly wouldn’t be room for servants. Not far from there are apartments, almshouses that housed some of Princess Margaret’s staff.  Prince William and Kate Middleton also stayed in \"Nott Cott,\" as it's referred to by the British press, for two years whenever they were in London.  Chris Jackson/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  For their wedding, Queen Elizabeth is supposedly gifting the couple a house at Sandringham Estate, in Norfolk, which is where the entire royal family spends the holiday season. That house has 21-rooms, which might be fun to decorate and make into a home, especially if they eventually have children.  The catch? That home is about 110 miles from London, and it seems a little odd that the young couple would want to be that far away from the hustle of the city. Harry did grow up at Kensington Palace, and Markle seems suited to city life, so it's entirely possible that they'll stay in Nottingham Cottage and keep the Sandringham Estate house for country getaways.  Then again, there are reportedly no air conditioners in the cottage and, according to Vanity Fair, Kate Middleton set up an entire system of fans when she lived there, so who knows how long they'll last in London-town after the wedding.  Wherever they end up living, they'll likely be very happy. And in the worst case scenario, they can always ask the Queen for some central air!\n",

            "text: Just when we tucked away our decorated teapots, fine china, English fascinators, and tea-party-approved shoes, it's time to get them back out once again. Yes, another Royal Wedding is happening—soon! On Friday, October 12th, Princess Eugenie, 28, and her fiancé, Jack Brooksbank, 31, will become the next new royal newlyweds.  On the polished heels of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding, another regal celebration is a welcomed jubilee. Here’s what we know about Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank’s planned nuptials.  Princess Eugenie, the youngest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York is ninth in line for the coveted throne—just behind her elder sister, Princess Beatrice. As reported by BBC News , Eugenie is a real working royal as a director at a gallery in Hauser and Wirth in London. Jack is a brand manager for Casamigos Tequila (co-founded by George Clooney who might be making his second royal wedding appearance of the year).  Royal watchers will recall that the couple officially announced their engagement via the Royal Family’s Twitter account this past January. As we previously reported , the couple met back in 2011 skiing in the Swiss Alps. From one epic location to meet (and fall in love) the location of their engagement was just as epic—near a lakeside Nicaraguan volcano —ah, young royal love.  After Jack bestowed Princess Eugenie with a stunning pink diamond sapphire engagement ring (so extra) it was announced that their marriage will take place at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor (the same place Harry and Meghan tied the knot).  As reported by Harper’s Bazaar , royal romantics at heart will be able to watch the next set of royals walk down the aisle as TLC will be the only network to broadcast the wedding in the United States. The viewing starts early—4:25 a.m. EST Friday, October 12th. So have your teapot hot and your scones pre-jammed for another English wedding spectacle.  While the past regal weddings have been very pomp-and-circumstance, this one is expected to be the same with an environmental-friendly no-plastic stance.  This past August, British Vogue shared the news that both Princess Eugenie and Jack are planning to have an eco-conscious planned wedding as she and her sister, Beatrice grew up in an “anti-plastic” home. She told British Vogue, “My whole house is anti-plastic now – and Jack and I want our wedding to be like that as well.”  Princess Eugenie, one of the few royals on Instagram, recently posted a regal black and white profile portrait captioning, “#tbt to some serious wedding daydreaming going on here. Pre-wedding vibes.”  Loading View on Instagram  While all anticipated wedding-watchers will have to tune in to see the final look of Eugenie’s wedding attire; it's safe to speculate that she'll wear a tiara. July 23, 1986, the wedding day of Eugenie’s mum, The Duchess of York wore a gifted diamond crown from the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Okay, now that’s extra.  The wedding sounds dreamy and all, but still you want to hit the ‘snooze’ button come Friday? No worries, the whole broadcast can be re-played on the TLC Go app—just reheat your tea (and crumpets) and you are good to go watch post-class!

            "text: Prince Harry is certainly one the most beloved members of the royal family, but he almost gave it all up to live a normal life. During a candid interview with the Mail on Sunday, the 32-year-old revealed that he considered giving up his royal life after serving in the army. \"I felt as though I was really achieving something,\" he said of his time serving with the British Army. \"I have a deep understanding of all sorts of people from different backgrounds and felt I was part of a team. I wasn't a prince; I was just Harry.\"  When he was forced to leave his first tour of Afghanistan when his location was revealed by the press in 2008, Harry admitted that he went through a bit of a rough patch. \"I spent many years kicking my heels and I didn't want to grow up,\" he said, referring to his partying past. Once he finally got things together though, he seriously contemplated leaving the royal life behind, but his loyalty to his grandmother Queen Elizabeth helped him in his decision to stay. \"I felt I wanted out but then decided to stay in and work out a role for myself. We don't want to be just a bunch of celebrities, but instead, use our role for good.\" And he's certainly doing just that. Aside from creating the Invictus Games to help wounded veterans and their families, Harry has been following in his late mother Princess Diana's footsteps by carrying on her charity work.\n",

She said: “He had a crush on Rachel Zane two years before he met Meghan and the reason I know is because I was having drinks with one of his friends. “She told me she’d been on a night out with Prince Harry. He was single at the time, so she said, ‘Harry, who’s your ideal girl?’ And he said ‘Meghan Markle from Suits.’” Prince Harry is said to have organised a meeting with his dream woman after having asked mutual friend Markus Anderson, a close friend of the divorcee, to set up a meeting between the two in order to fulfil his Rachel Zane fantasies.

According to The Sun, Ms Nicholl's added: “He asked Markus if he could set up, not a date, but an opportunity for them to meet and that happened in one of the private rooms of Soho House. “There were about seven or eight of them altogether and it was a perfect opportunity for Harry and Meghan to come together in a really informal environment and actually talk. “She was funny, feisty, confident and she wasn’t swayed or knocked by the fact that he was Prince Harry.

            "text: Following speculation earlier this week that Meghan Markle was seen walking her dog outside Kensington Palace in London, it's only natural to wonder how the Duchess goes about her day-to-day life when she's not partaking in royal duties.  According to People, Meghan has a foolproof way for living a low-key life when she isn't working. As a source tells the publication, Meghan apparently \"spends most of her weekends in the Cotswolds with Harry. When she does venture out to Pilates or to get her hair done, she normally goes incognito under a baseball cap.\" Just like in the movies, by wearing a cap and sunglasses, Meghan seems to manage going undetected in ordinary life.  Of course, Prince Harry and Meghan signed a two-year lease on a home in the Cotswolds following their May 2018 wedding, per Country Living. Based on the Great Tew Estate, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are able to escape London at the weekend. Notably, as Country Living reports, Soho Farmhouse, where Meghan had her spa-themed bachelorette party, is based nearby, making the Cotswolds a real home away from home for the former actress.  According to the Soho House website, the members' only club attracts mainly those working in \"film, fashion, advertising, music, art and media sectors,\" with Meghan's close friend, Markus Anderson, being a consultant for the brand.  Meghan and Harry are adjusting to their new life as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and it sounds as though they've found the perfect country hideaway to escape the limelight.\n",

The singer also attended the wedding earlier in Saturday in Windsor.  According to the Daily Mail, John took the stage after Prince Harry, following his speech, asked his guests, “Does anyone here know how to play the piano?” John then sat by the piano and performed four songs, “Your Song,” “Circle of Life,” “I’m Still Standing” and “Tiny Dancer”; the latter song features the lyric “L.A. lady,” a nod to Markle’s acting career.  Ellie Goulding similarly covered “Your Song” at the wedding of Harry’s brother Prince William and Kate Middleton.  “Prince Harry asked Sir Elton to perform at the Reception which was hosted by Her Majesty The Queen at St George’s Hall, Windsor Castle,” Kensington Palace confirmed in a statement. “Sir Elton performed for the newly married couple in recognition of the close connection he has with Prince Harry and his family.”  John notably performed a revised rendition of his “Candle in the Wind” at the funeral of Princess Diana, Harry’s mother, in 1997, and was a close friend of the royal family.  “I first met an extremely shy and sweet Prince Harry at a private lunch at Kensington Palace, given by his mother Princess Diana for Gianni Versace and me many years ago,” John once said. “What a joy it has been to see that young boy grow to inherit his mother’s warmth, sense of humor and courage to stand up and champion the causes he truly believes in.”  George and Amal Clooney, David and Victoria Beckham, Oprah Winfrey and Idris Elba were among the celebrities to attend the Royal Wedding.\n",

Prince Philip, 96, left the private King Edward VII hospital in London at midday on Friday; he was admitted on Tuesday 3 April.  Buckingham Palace said he would continue his recovery at Windsor, adding: “His royal highness would like to convey his appreciation for the messages of good wishes he has received.”  On Thursday, he was visited by his daughter, the princess royal, who said he was “on good form”.  Anne, whose visit lasted about 50 minutes, is believed to be theonly member of the royal family to visit Philip in the central London hospital.  The Queen also gave an update, telling a wellwisher in Windsor: “He said he’s getting on very well.”  The duke will have begun his rehabilitation, moving with the aid of a stick or crutches, and will face weeks of aftercare as he learns to walk again on his new hip.  For about a month before the operation, Philip had complained about trouble with the joint. Medical experts have said a few weeks after a hip replacement patients are usually back to their normal lifestyle, free from pain.  The Queen Mother underwent two successful hip replacement operations in the 1990s, first a planned procedure aged 95, followed by an emergency operation when she was 97.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding on 19 May is likely to be the first public appearance by the Queen’s consort since the operation.\n",

But even as Meghan joyfully prepares for her walk down the aisle and marriage to royalty, Markle reportedly is finding herself haunted by ghosts from her past. Ranging from Meghan’s former best friend, Ninaki Priddy, who allegedly betrayed Markle in a shocking way to jealous relatives and a possibly hostile ex-husband, those “ghosts” are darkening Meghan’s wedding plans, according to E! News.  Meghan Markle Reportedly Is Faced With Individuals From Her Past Who Want To Wreck Her Wedding Plans  While most of the people in Markle’s life are thrilled about her marriage to Prince Harry, some of those “ghosts” from her past are tormenting her, according to the publication.  “A few [individuals] seem hell-bent on trying to ruin the big [wedding] day. The torment Meghan Markle must be going through, thanks to a best friend from hell, jealous family members and a former spouse, is unimaginable.”  With a mere six weeks until Meghan and Harry tie the knot, the public Markle is focused on tasks such as getting fitted for her wedding dress, taking royal etiquette classes, and figuring out the politically charged seating arrangements. But it’s the behind-the-scenes antics that are reportedly the most intriguing.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tie the knot on Saturday, May 19, in St. George's Chapel on the grounds of Windsor Castle. Featured image credit: Chris Jackson Getty Images  Meghan Markle’s Brand Gets Makeover: Two “Ghosts” Get Killed Off  As an actress, Meghan was viewed as a brand with a distinctive voice, including her popular social media accounts. But as Markle prepares to become a duchess and member of the royal family, she is having to reinvent that brand. Meghan was fond of her social media platforms, sources told E! News, but now she must follow in Prince William’s, Kate Middleton’s, and Prince Harry’s footsteps. The trio use the same @KensingtonRoyal handle, and Markle’s appearances with Harry now are reported on Twitter with that handle.  null  Initially, Meghan’s social media platforms, including Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, were among the ghosts who haunted her. But those platforms, as well as her lifestyle website, the Tig, have been deleted.  In addition to social media, Markle’s style when she dated Prince Harry first reflected her old life. Short skirts, ripped jeans, and low necklines turned heads as she stepped out with a member of royalty. But just as she deleted her social media, Meghan has laid to rest her actress-era fashion.  “Gone [are Meghan Markle’s] short skirts and low necklines from her red-carpet days, replaced by more demure outfits of pants, skirts with longer hemlines, tailored coats and even a fashion-forward beret. Meghan 2.0 now looks every inch a style-conscious-yet-sensibly attired member of the regal elite.”  While Markle was able to deal with the end of her personal social media accounts, her website, and her former fashion in private, the people who form the “ghosts” in her life haven’t stopped haunting her.  Meghan Markle’s “Ghosts” Include People Who Betrayed Her  E! News pointed to Meghan’s half-sister, Samantha, as an example of one of the ghosts from Markle’s past who she can’t escape. Markle’s relative alleged that Markle had always wanted to be a princess, labeling her a social climber. Samantha even began penning a memoir titled The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister and announced plans for a reality show.  One of the most hurtful “ghosts” from Meghan’s past, and the most shocking, however, is her former best friend, Ninaki Priddy. For 30 years, the two were like sisters, from growing up together to Priddy’s role as the maid of honor at Markle’s wedding to Hollywood producer Trevor Engleson.  null  But as invitations to Meghan and Harry’s wedding are issued, Markle has been wounded by Ninaki spilling her secrets, pointed out E! News.  “When [Meghan Markle’s former best friend] Ninaki started to spill stories of their intimate conversations, it was a betrayal that must have felt like a stab in the heart to Meghan. Ninaki [claims] she is a calculating manipulator who was so obsessed with Princess Diana she made it her aim to marry Di’s son.”  Markle’s concerns about what might be revealed or alleged about her past don’t end with the betrayal from her best friend, however. Biographer Andrew Morton, known for infuriating the Palace with his book Diana: Her True Story, is set to publish his version of Meghan’s life. Morton reportedly will portray Markle as intensely ambitious, driven to become a member of the royal family.  There’s one person in Meghan’s life who supports her, and that’s her future husband, Prince Harry. Harry previously said that when he found the right woman, he would “ensure we get to the point where we are actually comfortable with each other before the massive invasion into her privacy.” With that “invasion” currently taking place, it’s thought that Prince Harry will stand by Meghan no matter what those ghosts claim about his beloved bride.\n",

            "text: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ‘Found Each Other to Change the World,’ Nacho Figueras Says  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s romance is one for the ages, according to their pal Nacho Figueras. The Argentine polo star, who appeared alongside the couple at the 2018 Sentebale ISPS Handa Polo Cup on Thursday, July 26, raved about the couple on Instagram and Twitter after the match, saying their love story serves a greater purpose.  “This girl really rocks. The more I know you, the more I am convinced that you both found each other to change the world,” he captioned a photo of himself presenting a trophy to the Duchess of Sussex. “Let’s push the envelope!! Let’s make the world a better place.”  Figueras, who is also a Ralph Lauren model, was on Harry’s team — the winning team — at Thursday’s match for Sentebale, an organization founded by the Duke of Sussex and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho. Sentebale aims to “become the leading organization in the provision of psychosocial support for children living with HIV in Southern Africa,” according to its website.  Thursday’s match raised more than £1 million for the charity. “@sentebale currently reaches nearly 4,000 young people a year with our unique programme of psychosocial support, so they can live long, happy, healthy lives,” Figueras captioned another photo. On a throwback pic of himself with Harry, he added that it was “an honor to be the captain of the @stregishotels Polo Team playing with this great man for a great cause.”  Figueras made headlines earlier this week when a photo of him with the royal couple went viral and sparked a series of memes. The image showed Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan celebrating his team’s victory with a kiss, as Figueras stood next to them awkwardly, trying to hand them the trophy.  Fortunately, the athlete had a good sense of humor about the situation and even joked about being the newlyweds’ third wheel in one of his posts. “When you wished the trophy would turn into a violin,” he quipped. “What an incredible love story.”  (photos via Chris Jackson/Getty Images)\n",

In an interview published in the Mail on Sunday, the prince said the time he spent in the army was \"the best escape I've ever had\" and that he thought about giving up his title.  He said: \"I felt I wanted out, but then decided to stay in and work out a role for myself.\"  Harry is fifth in line to the throne.  The comments followed an interview published in Newsweek in which he said he doubted anyone in the royal family wanted to be king or queen.

            "text: LONDON -- The father of the former Meghan Markle says he talked politics with Prince Harry over the phone -- and Harry said he should give President Donald Trump a chance. Thomas Markle told broadcaster ITV on Monday that he had several phone conversations with Harry, including one in which the prince asked for permission to marry his daughter.  Markle said Mr. Trump was discussed at least once: \"Our conversation was I was complaining about not liking Donald Trump, he said 'give Donald Trump a chance'. I sort of disagreed with that.\"  Markle said he also asked his future son-in-law about Britain's 2016 decision to leave the European Union and got the impression Harry is comfortable with Brexit.  \"I think he was open to the experiment,\" Markle said.  Harry's press office declined to comment on Markle's televised interview, which could raise eyebrows because senior royal figures are scrupulously careful not to comment publicly on domestic or international political affairs.  Markle, who had been scheduled to walk his daughter down the aisle, missed the royal wedding in May due to heart problems. He told ITV he was \"doing much better\" and that he regretted missing the big event.  The 73-year-old Markle, who watched the wedding from California, says he was \"very proud\" but that \"the unfortunate thing for me now is I'm a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history rather than the dad walking her down the aisle.\"  \"I can't think of a better replacement than someone like Prince Charles,\" he says of Prince Harry's own father, who walked Meghan most of the way down the aisle on her wedding day. \"He looked very handsome and my daughter looked beautiful with him. I was jealous, I wish I had been there, I wish it'd been me. But thank God he was there and thank him for that.\"  He says the couple, now known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will probably seek to have children soon.  \"She's wanted children for a long time,\" he said.  Markle said he gave Harry permission to marry his daughter over the phone.  \"Harry asked for her hand on the phone and I said: 'You are a gentleman, promise me you will never raise your hand against my daughter and of course I will grant you my permission. \"'\n",

            "text: Thomas Markle has claimed that Meghan has totally cut him off after not speaking for over 10 weeks  The retired television lighting director stated he had no way of contacting his daughter after Royal aides cut off all telephone links in the wake of previous comments he made to the media regarding the Royal Family. Speaking to the Mail on Sunday, Mr Markle said: “I’m really hurt that she’s cut me off completely. “I used to have a phone number and text number for her personal aides at the Palace, but after I said a few critical words about the Royal Family changing Meghan, they cut me off.” He expressed his sadness over the fact he has no means of sending his daughter a card ahead of her birthday on August 4, stating that if he sent one to Kensington Palace it would just be “one among thousands”.  I’m really hurt that she’s cut me off completely Thomas Markle  He added that he will likely not be able to see his grandchild should Meghan and Harry have children in the imminent future. Expressing his anguish, he told the paper: “How tragic is that, to deprive a child of its grandfather because I said a few things critical of the Royal Family.” Mr Markle came under sharp criticism after it was revealed he was paid for a set of staged paparazzi photographs ahead of the Royal wedding in May. But he expressed his confusion after receiving contradicting advice on what to do in response to the scandal.  Mr Markle expressed his sadness that he may not be able to see his potential future grandchildren  He noted that a Royal aide had said the photos had “offended the Royal Family” and called on him to offer an apology. Prince Harry then reportedly contradicted this statement, noting it was “unnecessary” to issue an apology as it would only “drag the story out a few more days”. While noting that Meghan is still “everything” to him, he stated he had “just about reached his limit” with his daughter and the Royal Family. In a stark warning, he said: “They want me to be silent, they want me to just go away. But I won't be silenced.” He criticised Meghan for her “sense of superiority”, and noted he had helped make her into the “Duchess she is today”.

            "text: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's first royal tour together is significant for so many reasons. Having announced that they're expecting their first child together, due in the Spring of 2019, the newlyweds have been greeted by royal fans in Australia this week. And the warm welcome is sure to continue as they travel to New Zealand, Fiji, and the Kingdom of Tonga in the coming days.  As they're now expecting a baby, it's exciting to see the Duke and Duchess of Sussex attending so many events together, and displaying such an impressive royal tour wardrobe along the way.  But what makes Meghan and Harry's appearance at the Invictus Games 2018 so significant is the fact that they first made their public debut as a couple at last year's event. And it's hard to believe just how much has happened in the last year.  On September 23, 2017, Meghan was spotted in the crowd at the Invictus Games in Toronto, the city in which she lived while filming Suits. She was there to support Prince Harry, who is heavily involved in the sporting event, which aims to support veterans and service people who have sustained injuries and disabilities while serving their countries:  Getty Images AFP Contributor  The separation didn't last long, though, as on September 25, 2017, Meghan and Harry attended a wheelchair tennis match in Toronto as part of the Invictus Games. Not only did they sit next to one another, but they also held hands, and looked very much in love throughout the event:  Getty Images Danny Lawson - PA Images  After that first public appearance, their relationship progressed fairly quickly, with the pair announcing their engagement on November 27, 2017:  Now, attending the Invictus Games 2018, Harry and Meghan look more unified than ever. Traveling to Sydney for the event, rather than Meghan's former home of Toronto, the Duke and Duchess have truly become a unit. Not only are they married, and starting a family, but they're jointly supporting the causes and organizations that are important to them both.  Having gotten married in May 2018, and announced Meghan's pregnancy at the start of the royal tour, it's clear that the Duke and Duchess aren't wasting time when it comes to their love story.\n",

Ready to throw a royal wedding viewing party? Click HERE for the ultimate guide.  Prince Charles will walk Markle down the aisle  Prince Charles will walk Markle from the quire, the area of St. George’s Chapel where the clergy and choir sit, to Harry. The procession in the nave, the central part of the church, will include Markle, the Dean of Windsor and Markle’s bridesmaids and page boys.  Markle originally asked her dad, Thomas Markle Sr., to walk her down the aisle but chose her soon-to-be father-in-law after her father became unable to attend the wedding.  Markle, 36, confirmed in a statement that her dad, who lives in Mexico, will not attend the wedding due to health concerns.  Who's who in the wedding party  Markle will not have a maid of honor by her side, as she did not want to single out one of her close circle of friends, sources told ABC News.  She will though have bridesmaids and page boys, all children, by her side at her wedding.  William and Kate's children -- Prince George and Princess Charlotte -- will take center stage at the wedding as a page boy and bridesmaid, respectively.  Karwai Tang/WireImage via Getty Images  Also joining Charlotte and George in the wedding party will be the three children of Markle's best friend, entrepreneur and style adviser Jessica Mulroney.  Ivy Mulroney, 4, will serve as a bridesmaid, while her older brothers, 7-year-old twins Brian and John Mulroney, will join George as page boys.  Also serving as a page boy will be Jasper Dyer, the 6-year-old son of Harry's mentor and close friend, Capt. Mark Dyer.  Joining Charlotte and Ivy as bridesmaids will be two of Harry's goddaughters -- 3-year-old Florence van Cutsem and 2-year-old Zalie Warren -- and two of Markle's goddaughters, 7-year-old Rylan Litt and her 6-year-old sister, Remi Litt.  William will serve as best man on May 19, just as Harry served as best man at William and Kate's wedding in 2011.  George Pimentel/WireImage/Getty Images  Who will design Markle's dress?  A top contender for designing Markle's gown is the design duo behind Ralph & Russo.  Australian-born designers Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo drew the spotlight when Markle chose their jaw-dropping $75,000 gown for her engagement photos with Harry last December.  Other possibilities for the coveted design assignment have included Christopher Bailey, the visionary behind the iconic British brand Burberry, British designer Stella McCartney, Canadian designer Erdem Moralioglu, and Roland Mouret, a close friend of Markle's.  George Pimentel/WireImage/Getty Images  British designer Victoria Beckham, whose sweater Markle wore in her engagement photos with Harry, has denied she is creating Markle's dress.  \"Sadly not, but I'm sure she will look incredible in whatever she wears,\" Beckham said on the April 12th episode of CBS' \"The Late Late Show With James Corden.\"  Markle had her first fitting with the unnamed designer in January at Kensington Palace, royal reporter Omid Scobie told ABC News at the time.  Markle's mom's important role  Markle’s mom, Doria Ragland, is expected to be the only member of her family attending the wedding. She will accompany Markle by car from her overnight location to Windsor Castle on the day of the wedding.

Lady Jane Fellowes, Diana's sister, will deliver the reading at the wedding.  Both Markle and Harry have said how important it is that Harry's late mother be included in their wedding.  Anwar Hussein/Getty Images  \"I think she would be over the moon, jumping up and down, so excited for me,\" Harry said when his engagement to Markle was announced. \"But then, as I said, [she] would've probably been best friends with Meghan.\"  Markle's engagement ring features two diamonds from Diana's personal collection.  \"The little diamonds on either side are from my mother's jewelry collection to make sure that she's with us on this crazy journey together,\" Harry said in November.  Location, location, location  Harry and Markle will wed at St. George’s Chapel on the grounds of Windsor Castle, about 22 miles outside of London.  St. George's Chapel is a smaller venue than Westminster Abbey, where Prince William and Kate tied the knot in 2011, and St. Paul's Cathedral, where Prince Charles and Diana wed in 1981.  Dominic Lipinski/AFP/Getty Images  The chapel, which can seat 800 people, is where Harry was baptized in 1984. It is also where Harry's father, Prince Charles, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, held a service of prayer and dedication at the chapel in 2005 following their marriage at Guild Hall.  The last royal wedding to be held at St. George's Chapel was a decade ago, when Peter Phillips wed Autumn Kelly in May 2008, according to the chapel's website.  Where Harry and Markle will stay  The couple will stay at separate hotels on the eve of their wedding.  Harry will be joined by his best man, William, at the Dorchester Collection's Coworth Park. Markle and her mother will stay at Cliveden House Hotel, on the National Trust's Cliveden Estate, according to Kensington Palace.  Wedding day lineup  The wedding will begin at noon local time, 7 a.m., ET, on May 19.  The Right Rev. David Conner, the dean of Windsor, will conduct the wedding service. The Most Rev. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, who baptized and confirmed Markle, will officiate when the couple takes their marriage vows.  The Most Reverend Michael Bruce Curry, the 27th Presiding Bishop and Primate of The Episcopal Church, will give the address at the wedding.

Markle will also enter the chapel through the west steps, joined by some of the bridesmaids and page boys.  Following the hour-long wedding ceremony, the couple will meet in the chapel's Horseshoe Cloisterwith with 200 representatives of charities for which Harry has served as patron.  Harry and Markle plan to undertake a carriage procession that will start at St. George's Chapel, leave Windsor Castle via Castle Hill, continue along High Street through Windsor Town before returning to Windsor Castle on a route called the Long Walk.  Steve Parsons/PA Wire/PA Images  They will be waved off on their carriage ride by members of the Royal Family. The guests at the wedding service will observe the sendoff of the carriage procession.  After the carriage procession, the newlyweds will attend a lunchtime reception, hosted by Queen Elizabeth, at St. George's Hall, where they will rejoin their wedding guests.  In the evening, a smaller group of 200 guests will attend a reception hosted by Harry’s father, Prince Charles, at Frogmore House.  Frogmore House, also on the grounds of Windsor Castle, is the location Markle and Harry chose for their intimate engagement photos released by Kensington Palace in December.  Both receptions will be closed to the public but there may be a second glimpse of Markle and Harry when they depart Windsor Castle for Frogmore House in the evening.  The wedding cake's California connection  Harry and Markle selected pastry chef Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, East London, to design their wedding cake.  Ptak, like Markle, was raised in California before moving to London. Her bakery is notable for using seasonal and organic ingredients in cakes.  Ptak is creating a lemon elderflower cake with buttercream icing and fresh flowers as decorations, according to Kensington Palace.  ?? 200 Amalfi lemons  ?? 500 organic eggs from Suffolk  ?? 20kgs of butter  ?? 20kgs of flour  ?? 20kgs of sugar  ?? 10 bottles of Sandringham Elderflower Cordial The baking of the #RoyalWedding cake is under way! pic.twitter.com/b3jhwtOwOP — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 18, 2018  The choice of a lemon elderflower cake is a departure from the royal tradition of serving British fruit cake on the wedding day.  William and Kate had two cakes on their wedding day in 2011, a traditional eight-tier fruit cake created by chef Fiona Cairns and a chocolate biscuit cake from a beloved Buckingham Palace recipe.  See the gilded wedding invitations  Roughly 600 invitations to Harry and Markle's wedding have been issued, Kensington Palace announced in late March.  Victoria Jones/Pool via AP  The invitations are printed in gold and black on English card using American ink, a process that some saw as a nod to Markle's American roots.  Issued “in the name of His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales,\" each invitation is accented with gilded edges and features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales, according to Kensington Palace. The names of invited guests were added by a calligraphy printer.  Victoria Jones/Pool via AP  The invitations were produced by Barnard & Westwood, a London-based fine printers and bookbinders company that has been making royal invitations since 1985.  The man behind the camera  Harry and Markle have selected Alexi Lubomirski to be the official photographer at their wedding.  PA Wire/AP  Lubomirski, a renowned portrait and fashion photographer, will take the official photographs at Windsor Castle following Harry and Markle's wedding at St George's Chapel.  Lubomirski is a former assistant to Mario Testino, who was a favorite photographer of Harry's mother, the late Princess Diana.  He was also selected by Harry and Markle to take their engagement photos at Frogmore House, Windsor, that were released by Kensington Palace in December.  Markle's favorite bloom in the wedding flowers  The wedding floral displays in St. George's Chapel will include white garden roses foxgloves and peonies, Markle’s favorite bloom, as well as local branches of beech, birch, and hornbeam.  Markle and Harry have chosen Philippa Craddock to design the flowers for both the church service at St. George’s Chapel and the wedding reception at St. George’s Hall hosted by Queen Elizabeth.  Craddock, based in Fulham, is one of the most notable florists in London, with clients including Kensington Palace, Hampton Court Palace, Alexander McQueen, Christian Dior, the Victoria and Albert Museum and British Vogue.  Where possible, Philippa will use flowers and plants that are in season and blooming naturally in May, including branches of beech, birch and hornbeam, as well as white garden roses, peonies and foxgloves. — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) April 1, 2018  The flowers -- which will also include locally-sourced foliage from areas around Windsor Castle -- will be donated to various charities after the wedding, according to Kensington Palace.  The soundtrack of the wedding  Harry and Markle's wedding day will be illuminated by the sounds of a gospel choir, an organ, trumpets, a full orchestra, a soprano and a 19-year-old cellist who was personally asked by Markle.  \"I was bowled over when Ms. Markle called me to ask if I would play during the ceremony,\" Sheku Kanneh-Mason said in a statement released by Kensington Palace. \"And of course I immediately said yes. What a privilege to be able to play the cello at such a wonderful event. I can’t wait!”  19-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, winner of 2016 @BBCYoungMus. Last June, Prince Harry saw Sheku play at an event in London in support of the work of Antiguan charity the Halo Foundation. pic.twitter.com/C3QSfcbXJl — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) April 24, 2018  The music during the wedding ceremony will be under the direction of St. George's Chapel's director of music, James Vivian, and will also include the choir of St. George's Chapel, according to Kensington Palace.  The entire ceremony will also be recorded live and released on Decca Records, a U.K.-based records label. The album, which will include a collector's booklet, will go on sale around the world on May 25, according to Decca Records.  Harry and Markle's horse-drawn royal carriage  The newlyweds will travel through Windsor Town and along the Long Walk in the Ascot Landau carriage.  The carriage, which will be pulled by Windsor Grey horses, is one of five Ascot Landaus used by the royal family. Two of the Ascot Landaus were used at William and Kate's 2011 wedding, including carrying Harry in his role as best man.  Take a closer look at the Ascot Landau carriage, which will take Prince Harry and Ms. Markle on a procession through Windsor Town after their wedding. pic.twitter.com/pXHg2tIjKS — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 2, 2018  The most celeb-studded royal wedding to date?  Among the high-profile guests who could attend Harry and Markle's wedding are some of Markle's celebrity friends, including actress Priyanka Chopra and tennis star Serena Williams.  Getty Images  Former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama will not be at the wedding at Windsor Castle, despite speculation they would attend. It is unclear whether the Obamas received an invitation but declined to avoid a political distraction.  Markle and Harry decided against inviting political leaders from the U.K. and abroad to their wedding, meaning President Donald Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May will not attend.  Markle has though invited several members of the cast of \"Suits,\" the TV show she starred on for seven seasons, ABC News has learned. Also expected to attend the wedding ceremony is Elton John, one of Diana’s closest friends who has worked with Harry on AIDs policy.  Singers Ed Sheeran and Rihanna and members of Coldplay, who have all actively supported Harry's charitable work, could also get invites.  Spice Girls star Mel B said on a talk show in February that all five Spice Girls have been invited to Harry and Markle's wedding.  Stefan Wermuth/Reuters, FILE  Mel B declined to comment on whether the Spice Girls would perform on the big day, saying, \"You’re going to get me fired! Let’s not talk about it anymore! Let’s pretend that I never said that.”  Other members of the girl band have since indicated they will not be performing.  Prince William and Princess Kate invited Ellie Goulding to perform at their wedding reception in 2011.  Everyday people will play a role  Harry and Markle have invited 2,640 people onto the grounds of Windsor Castle to see the wedding carriage procession as it departs.  Matt Dunham/AP  Members of the public were selected from different regions of the U.K. with a special emphasis on those who have served their community. The couple also invited 100 students from two local schools in Windsor that have a strong affiliation with Windsor Castle.  Harry and Markle also extended invitations to 200 individuals who take part in charities and organizations for which Harry serves as royal patron.  Armed Forces will play a role too  More than 250 members of the Armed Forces will provide ceremonial support at both the wedding and the carriage procession, according to the U.K. Ministry of Defense.  \"Members of the Household Cavalry will form a staircase party at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle as part of the wedding,\" the statement reads. \"The State Trumpeters and a Captain’s Escort from the Household Cavalry will also provide ceremonial support.\"  The members will come from British Armed Forces units with a “special relationship” to Harry, a veteran. Harry served two tours of duty in Afghanistan and rose to the rank of Captain during his time in the military.  Prince Harry and Ms. Markle are pleased that members of the Armed Forces will play such a special role in their Wedding. The Military, and these units in particular, hold a great significance for Prince Harry and the couple are incredibly grateful for their support. — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) March 28, 2018  Is Markle planning this all on her own?  Markle's best friend and stylist, Jessica Mulroney, is also a bridal planner and assisting Markle in the entire design and concept of the wedding party outfits and look for the reception.  George Pimentel/Getty Images  Mulroney is Canada’s best-known stylist who styled Markle during her seven-season run on the TV drama \"Suits,\" which films in Toronto.  Since Markle's engagement to Harry, Mulroney helped select the dress and coat Markle wore on the day the couple's engagement was announced in November. Mulroney was also at Markle's side advising her on the gown and sweater Markle wore for her intimate engagement photos with Harry.  Mulroney is the wife of Ben Mulroney, whose father is a former prime minister of Canada. The two are one of Canada's best-known power couples and are often considered Canadian royalty in Toronto.  Who is paying for this celebration?  Kensington Palace confirmed in a statement released after the couple’s engagement that Harry’s family would pay for the “core aspects of the wedding.”  \"As was the case with the wedding of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, The Royal Family will pay for the core aspects of the wedding, such as the church service, the associated music, flowers, decorations, and the reception afterwards,” the statement read.

            "text: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are set to have the wedding of the year this coming spring, but don’t expect their royal affair to be a copy of Prince William and Duchess Kate’s 2011 ceremony. Here’s what we know so far about how the wedding will be different.  On Tuesday, Kensington Palace announced that the wedding will take place in May 2018 at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle. The Queen has approved the venue, and the royal family will pay for the wedding.

At least three services take place there every day, and all are open to the public. Windsor Castle, where the Queen lives for part of every year, is located about 20 miles west of London. \"Windsor is a very special place for Prince Harry and he and Ms. Markle have regularly spent time there over the last year and a half,\" Kensington Palace said in a statement. Harry himself was christened there in 1984, so by the rules of the Church of England, he can be married there.  St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.

Getty Images  Though William and Kate were married in Westminster Abbey in 2011 and Prince Charles and Princess Diana were married at St. Paul’s Cathedral in 1981, Harry's wedding won’t be the first time a recent royal has married at St. George’s. According to NBC News, Harry’s uncle, Prince Edward, married Sophie Rhys-Jones there in 1999, and his cousin, Peter Phillips, married Autumn Kelly at the chapel in 2008. Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles had a televised religious blessing there after they had a civil wedding ceremony nearby in 2005.  The space is much smaller than Westminster Abbey, holding around 800 people compared to the Abbey's whopping 2,000, The Guardian reports. Harry and Meghan plan on making the ceremony reflect their personalities and they're determining a way to involve the public in some way, their spokesman revealed. Either way, the tone seems like it will be much different from William and Kate’s pomp and circumstance.  “It will be a moment of fun and joy that will reflect the character of the bride and groom,” their spokesman told journalists. “The couple of course want the day to be a special, celebratory moment for their friends and family. They also want the day to be shaped so as to allow members of the public to feel part of the celebrations too and are currently working through ideas for how this might be achieved.”\n",

            "text: Duchess of Sussex redirects here. For the title, see Duke of Sussex  American member of the British royal family, and former actress  Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (born Rachel Meghan Markle; August 4, 1981), is an American-born member of the British royal family and a former film and television actress.  Markle was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and is of mixed-race heritage. During her studies at Northwestern University, she began playing small roles in American television series and films. From 2011 to 2017, she played her best-known role, Rachel Zane, on the American legal drama series Suits. As an outspoken feminist, Markle has addressed issues of gender inequality, and her lifestyle website The Tig featured a column profiling influential women. Her humanitarian work in the 2010s saw her represent international charity organizations. She has received recognition for her fashion and style, releasing a line of clothing in 2016.  From 2011 until their divorce in 2013, Markle was married to actor and producer Trevor Engelson. In 2017, she announced her engagement to Prince Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, and moved to London. She consequently retired from acting, closed her social media accounts, and started undertaking public engagements on behalf of the British royal family. Following their wedding on May 19, 2018, Markle became known as the Duchess of Sussex.  Early life and education  Rachel Meghan Markle was born on August 4, 1981, in Los Angeles, California,[1] at West Park Hospital in Canoga Park.[2] As of 2017, her mother, Doria Ragland, a social worker and yoga instructor lives in View Park–Windsor Hills, California.[1][3] Markle has often described a very close friendship with her mother.[4] Her father, Thomas Markle Sr., who lives in Rosarito, Mexico,[5][6] is a retired television director of photography and lighting director, whose profession resulted in his young daughter often visiting the set of Married...with Children.[7][8] Markle's parents divorced when she was six years old.[9][10] She has two older paternal half-siblings, Thomas Markle Jr. and Samantha Markle, from whom she is reportedly estranged.[11]  Describing her heritage in a 2015 essay for Elle, Markle states that her \"dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I'm half black and half white ... While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.\"[12]  Markle grew up in Hollywood.[13] She was educated at private schools, beginning at age two at the Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse.[14][15] At age 11, her successful campaign to get Proctor & Gamble to change a national television commercial she viewed as sexist was profiled by Linda Ellerbee on Nick News.[16] Though she was raised as a Protestant,[17] Markle attended Immaculate Heart High School, an all-girl Catholic private school in Los Angeles.[18] She then attended Northwestern University, where she joined Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and participated in community service and charity projects.[19][20] Markle graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 2003 with a bachelor's degree and a double major in theater and international studies.[21][22] She also served an internship at the American embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina,[22] and studied for a semester in Madrid, Spain.[20]  Acting career  Early in her career, Markle worked as a freelance calligrapher to support herself between acting jobs.[7] Her first on-screen appearance was a small role as a nurse in an episode of the daytime soap opera General Hospital.[23][24] Markle had small guest roles on the television shows Century City (2004), The War at Home (2006), and CSI: NY (2006).[24] She also took on several contract acting and modeling jobs, including a stint as a \"briefcase girl\" on the US game show Deal or No Deal.[7] She appeared in Fox's series Fringe as Junior Agent Amy Jessup in the first two episodes of its second season.[25] Markle had some difficulty getting roles early in her career. In 2015, she wrote: \"Being 'ethnically ambiguous', as I was pegged in the industry, meant I could audition for virtually any role ... Sadly, it didn't matter: I wasn't black enough for the black roles and I wasn't white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn't book a job.\"[26]  In July 2011, Markle joined the cast of the USA Network show Suits, playing Rachel Zane. The character began as a paralegal and eventually became an attorney. She completed work on the seventh season in late 2017.[27] According to a critique in The Irish Times, Markle deftly and \"actively re-positioned\" her character from ingenue to \"the show's moral conscience\" and gave viewers the unique portrayal of a daughter, whose African-American father is in a position to help her career and advance her \"desire to crack both racial and gender glass ceilings\".[28] She appeared in two 2010 films, Get Him to the Greek and Remember Me, and one 2011 film, Horrible Bosses.[29] She also appeared in episodes of Cuts; Love, Inc.; 90210; Knight Rider; Without a Trace; The League; and Castle.[24][30]  From 2014 to 2017, she was founder and editor-in-chief of the lifestyle website The Tig,[31][32] a name she derived from Tignanello red wine.[33] One of The Tig's features was \"Tig Talk\", a column that profiled women including Jessica Alba,[34] Gail Simmons,[35] Ella Woodward,[36] Daphne Oz,[37] Elizabeth Hurley,[38] Lauren Bush,[39] Ivanka Trump,[40] Dianna Agron[41] and Jessica Stam.[42] She closed The Tig in April 2017,[43] and in January 2018, she deleted all of her social media accounts. At the time of its closing, her Instagram account had 1.9 million followers.[44] In a statement issued by Kensington Palace, Markle thanked \"everyone who has followed her social media accounts over the years\".[45][46]  In November 2016, Markle and Canadian clothing company Reitmans released lines of women's fashion workwear and casual-wear.[47] The lines, based on her personal style, and that of her Suits character, described as \"aspirational girl next door\", quickly sold out.[44] In 2010, Markle was paid $187,000 for her role in Remember Me and $171,429 for her role in the short film The Candidate.[48] For her role on Suits, Fortune magazine estimated that Markle was paid $50,000 per episode, amounting to an annual salary of about $450,000.[49] In addition, it was estimated that as a lifestyle blogger she earned about $80,000 annually from endorsements and sponsorships.[48] In 2017, her total net worth was estimated at $5 million.[48] In 2018, she was among the nominees for the 2018 Teen Choice Awards in the category Choice Style Icon.[50]  Personal life  Markle began a relationship with actor and producer Trevor Engelson in 2004.[51][52] They married in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, on September 10, 2011,[53] and separated through a no-fault divorce in August 2013,[54] citing irreconcilable differences.[55]  Markle was in a relationship with celebrity chef and restaurateur Cory Vitiello for almost two years.[56] They lived together in their residence in Toronto.[57] Their relationship ended in May 2016.[56]  Markle and Prince Harry attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  In June 2016, Markle began a relationship with Prince Harry,[58][59] who was then fifth in line to the British throne.[60] Markle and Prince Harry met on a blind date set up by a mutual friend.[61] The press began to report on the relationship in October 2016.[62] On November 8, 2016, the British royal family's communications secretary released an official statement that addressed a \"wave of abuse and harassment\" directed toward Markle.[63] The statement described sexism, racism and defamatory stories directed at her.[64][65][66] During a September 2017 interview with Vanity Fair, Markle spoke in public for the first time about her love for Prince Harry.[67] Later that month, they made their first public appearance together at an official royal engagement at the Invictus Games in Toronto.[68][69]  While working on Suits, Markle lived in a rented house in the Seaton Village neighborhood of Toronto, Canada, where the show is filmed.[70] She lived in Canada for nine months each year, making a few close friends.[44] She moved out in late November 2017 after work on the seventh season had been completed.[71]  Markle has two rescue dogs, a labrador-shepherd named Bogart and a beagle named Guy, whom she adopted in 2012 and 2015 respectively.[72][73]  Royal marriage  Markle's engagement to Prince Harry was announced on November 27, 2017.[58][74] By then, she had met Queen Elizabeth II, Harry's paternal grandmother, several times.[75] The engagement announcement prompted generally positive comment about the possible social significance of a mixed-race member of the royal family.[76] The ring Harry gave Markle consists of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from the jewellery collection of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.[77] Following the engagement, Markle announced she would retire from acting,[78][79] and began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[80]  In preparation for the wedding, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, baptised Markle and confirmed her into the Church of England on March 6, 2018.[81] The private ceremony, performed with water from the River Jordan, took place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace.[81] The marriage ceremony was held on May 19, 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[82] The Duke and Duchess live at Nottingham Cottage in London, in the grounds of Kensington Palace.[83]  Public life  Markle greeting the public in Belfast, March 2018  Markle accompanied Harry for the first time during an official public appearance after their engagement at a walkabout in Nottingham on December 1, 2017,[84][85] in connection with World AIDS Day.[86] The Queen invited them to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at her Sandringham estate.[87] In early 2018, Markle accompanied Harry on his engagements in Brixton,[86] Cardiff,[88] Goldsmiths' Hall,[89] and Edinburgh.[90] On February 28, 2018, Markle attended an official engagement at the first annual forum of The Royal Foundation, \"Making a Difference Together\" with the prince.[91] She became the fourth patron, alongside Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, after her marriage into the royal family.[92] Markle and Harry marked International Women's Day by attending an event in Birmingham hosted by the Stemettes.[93] Along with the Queen and other members of the royal family, she attended the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on March 12, 2018.[94] The couple made their first visit to Northern Ireland on March 23, 2018.[95] Markle carried out a total of 26 public engagements prior to the wedding.[96]  The Duchess's first official engagement after the wedding came on May 22 when she and her husband attended Prince Charles' 70th birthday garden party to celebrate his charity work.[97] Her first trip abroad at the request of the British government was to Dublin, Ireland, in July 2018.[98][99] According to a review in The Irish Times, her visit became a unique national obsession.[100] In June 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the Duke and Duchess would tour Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand around the time of the Invictus Games which will be held in Sydney in October 2018.[101][102]  Fashion and style  Markle cited Emmanuelle Alt as her style inspiration in 2017.[103][104] In an interview with Glamour, the Duchess said that she favored \"that French way of styling, where if your outfit is pulled together, then something's got to be dishevelled—your hair, your make-up\".[103] In her youth, Markle's \"sensibility had always been relaxed California girl style\" consisting of jeans, cut-offs and flip-flops.[104] She usually prefers \"streamlined dresses\" with \"neutral colors\" and boat-neck necklines,[105][106] and likes \"monochromatic and tonal dressing\".[104] She has worn outfits and ensembles by many fashion designers.[103] The media takes note of the brands she uses.[103]  In December 2017, Markle caused a surge in interest in Scottish retailer Strathberry after carrying one of their handbags to a public event shortly after her engagement.[107][108] This was reported as an indication that her fashion choices would produce her own version of the Kate effect.[107][109] It has been speculated that Markle's effect would be greater, as she has a strong appeal in America.[109] After Markle and Prince Harry's first appearance as a couple, brands Mackage, Birks, R&R Jewelers, Crown Jewelers and Everlane noted an upswing in their website hits and sales.[110][111][108]  Charity work  Markle was a counselor for international charity One Young World. She attended its 2014 and 2016 summits.[112] At the 2014 summit in Dublin, she spoke on the topics of gender equality and modern-day slavery.[113] Also in 2014, she traveled to Afghanistan and Spain as part of the United Service Organizations Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Holiday Tour.[114][115][116]  In 2016, Markle became a global ambassador for World Vision Canada, traveling to Rwanda for the Clean Water Campaign, the agency's campaign to provide safe, clean drinking water,[117][118][26] and she traveled to India to raise awareness of issues concerning women.[119] Upon returning from India, she penned an op-ed for Time magazine concerning stigmatization of women in regard to menstrual health.[120] She has also worked with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women as an Advocate.[117][121] The Duchess is a vocal feminist and likely to use her role as a member of the royal family to continue supporting women's rights and social justice.[122]  In 2018, Time magazine included Markle on its list 100 Most Influential People in the World.[123][124] She was also chosen as one of the most influential women in the United Kingdom by Vogue magazine.[125]  Titles, styles, and arms  Titles and styles  Royal monogram  Upon her marriage to Prince Harry, Meghan Markle became a princess of the United Kingdom entitled to the style of Royal Highness, as well as Duchess of Sussex, Countess of Dumbarton and Baroness Kilkeel.[126][127] She is styled as \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex\",[128] and she is the first person to hold that title.[129]  Arms  Ancestry  On her mother's side, the Duchess of Sussex is descended from African Americans enslaved in Georgia,[132] and on her father's side from German,[133] English,[134] and Irish settlers.[135] One of her possible forefathers, Heinrich Martin Merckel, emigrated to the United States from Lampertsloch, an historically German-speaking town in Alsace, and later changed the spelling of his name to Markle.[133] Among her father's distant ancestors are Captain Christopher Hussey, King Robert I of Scotland, Sir Philip Wentworth, and Edward III of England.[136][137]  Filmography  Television  Film  References\n",

            "text: The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom. The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3]  Announcement of engagement [ edit ]  Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the \"wave of abuse and harassment\" directed toward Markle.[5]  Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8]  The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8]  During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11]  Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17]  Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20]  Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at the Queen's Sandringham estate.[28] The official engagement photographs were taken by Alexi Lubomirski (a former assistant to Mario Testino) at Frogmore House, and were issued by Kensington Palace on 21 December 2017.[29]  To mark the wedding of Harry and Meghan, the Royal Mint produced an official UK £5 coin, showing the couple in profile.[30] In May, a set of commemorative postage stamps, featuring the couple's official engagement photographs, was issued by Royal Mail.[31]  Wedding [ edit ]  Planning [ edit ]  Preparation for wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle  Unlike the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the wedding day of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was not declared a bank holiday.[32] The wedding was on the same date as the FA Cup Final, which Prince Harry's brother William normally attends in his role as President of the Football Association.[33] Holding the royal wedding on a weekend is a break with the royal tradition of having weddings on a weekday.[34] On 12 February 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the ceremony would commence at 12:00 Midday BST.  Venue [ edit ]  The wedding took place on Saturday, 19 May 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor.[35] The chapel had previously been the venue for the weddings of Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as that of his cousin, Peter Phillips, and for the blessing of the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Harry's stepmother.[36]  Cost [ edit ]  The royal family announced that they would pay for the wedding.[37] The costs for the cake, the florist, and the catering had been estimated to be £50,000, £110,000, and £286,000 respectively,[38] and the overall cost was expected to be around £32 million.[39] The security costs were expected to be lower than those of the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.[40] By the end of May, it was estimated that the security costs were \"between £2 million and £4 million\". The police and crime commissioner could also apply for special funding if the costs were to exceed 1% of the Thames Valley Police force's annual budget, but at the time the cost was \"well below the £4 million required to make a claim\".[41] The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead reportedly spent £2.6 million on cleaning the town and roads.[40] It was predicted that the wedding would trigger a tourism boom and boost the economy by up to £500 million.[42]  Wedding attire [ edit ]  The wedding invitations specified a dress code for men of \"Dress Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit\"; for women, \"Day Dress and Hat\".[43]  Bride and bridesmaids [ edit ]  The wedding dress was designed by the British designer Clare Waight Keller under the aegis of the fashion house Givenchy.[44] It was made of \"double-bonded silk cady cushioned by an underskirt in triple silk organza\" and had a boat neckline, long sleeves and sweeping train.[45][46] The silk veil was 16 feet (4.9 m) long and was embroidered with 55 flowers, representing the 53 countries of the Commonwealth,[45][47] as well as Wintersweet, which grows in front of Nottingham Cottage, where she and Harry live, and the California Poppy, the state flower of California.[48] It was secured by a diamond bandeau tiara, made in 1932 for Queen Mary and lent to Markle by Queen Elizabeth II.[45][49] The centre brooch had been a wedding gift from the County of Lincoln in 1893. The tiara is a platinum band, made up of eleven sections, a detachable centre brooch with interlaced opals and diamonds.[50] The shoes were also from Givenchy, and had a pointed couture design.[45]  Other ensembles worn by the bride included white gold and diamond earrings and bracelet made by Cartier.[45][49][51] Markle's hair was rolled up with \"face-framing fringe tucked behind her ears\",[52] and was done by Serge Normant.[53] Make-up artist Daniel Martin did Markle's makeup for the occasion.[52][54] The look was described as \"a soft brown eyeshadow\" with minimal makeup on the face.[52] Her nails were painted in a \"neutral pink-y beige\" for the ceremony.[55] The bride's bouquet, designed by Philippa Craddock, contained \"forget-me-nots, scented sweet peas, lily of the valley, astilbe, jasmine and astrantia, and sprigs of myrtle\".[45] The flowers were chosen by the groom who handpicked forget-me-nots in honour of his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales.[45][56] After the wedding the bridal bouquet was placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey, following royal tradition that began with the Queen Mother.[57] For the customary bridal themes of \"Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue\", Markle had her gown and veil (the \"new\"), the Queen's tiara (the \"borrowed\"), sprigs of myrtle taken from \"a plant grown from the myrtle used in the Queen's wedding bouquet\" and a piece of fabric from Diana, Princess of Wales's wedding gown (the \"old\"), and finally a piece of fabric from the dress she wore on their first date stitched in the veil (the \"blue\").[58][59][60] The young bridesmaids also wore high-waisted silk dresses designed by Clare Waight Keller which had puff sleeves.[61]  Groom, best man and page boys [ edit ]  Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge wore the frock coat uniform of the Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons) in which both were commissioned,[note 3] and Prince Harry served for 10 years, including in combat in Afghanistan.[62] The uniforms were made by Dege & Skinner, gentleman's tailors and uniform makers, of Savile Row, London.[63][64] The groom asked for and received the Queen's permission to keep his beard, as beards are only permitted under exceptional circumstances in the British Army.[62] Prince Harry wore the rank of major with the star of the Royal Victorian Order, of which he is a Knight Commander, along with the ribbons of the Royal Victorian Order, Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan, Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, and Army Air Corps wings.[65] Prince William, also with the rank of major, had EIIR cyphers on his shoulder straps and gold aiguillettes on his right shoulder (indicating his position as an aide-de-camp to the Queen), and wore the star of the Order of the Garter, the ribbons of the two jubilee medals, and his RAF wings.[63][66] The pageboys wore uniforms by Dege & Skinner that resembled the uniform of the Blues and Royals worn by the groom and best man. Each page boy had his initials on the shoulders in place of rank badges.[63]  Wedding party [ edit ]  On 26 April 2018, Kensington Palace announced that Prince Harry had selected his older brother, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, as his best man.[67][68] There was initially no confirmation as to whether Prince William would miss the FA Cup Final, which he would normally attend in his role as President of The Football Association, or if he would be able to attend both the wedding and the football. A statement from Kensington Palace that the timing of the wedding would not clash with the match was released in December 2017.[69] However, it was confirmed in March that the Duke would not be attending the final that day.[70]  There were suggestions that the bride's friend Jessica Mulroney would be her maid of honour.[71][72] In early May 2018, there was confirmation that there would be no maid of honour, and that the bridesmaids and page boys would all be children.[73] A total of ten bridesmaids and page boys were chosen, with the bride and groom each selecting five: two of Markle's godchildren, seven-year old Rylan Ritt and her six-year-old sister Remi, as well as Brian, John and Ivy Mulroney, the three children of her friend Jessica Mulroney, were chosen by the bride, while Prince Harry's nephew and niece, Prince George and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, as well as his godchildren Florence van Cutsem, Zalie Warren and Jasper Dyer, were selected by the groom.[74][75]  On 18 May 2018, Kensington Palace announced Prince Charles would accompany Markle down the aisle, after she confirmed her father, Thomas Markle Sr., would not be attending the wedding due to his recent heart surgery.[76][77] The bride spent the night before the wedding at Cliveden House along with her mother, while the groom stayed at Coworth Park Hotel with his brother.[78][79] Markle made her way to the church accompanied by her mother.[80]  Approximately 250 members of the British Armed Forces were involved in the wedding, the majority coming from units that have a connection with Prince Harry:[81]  Wedding service [ edit ]  The wedding service was conducted according to the Christian liturgy for Holy Matrimony as set out in Common Worship of the Church of England, mother Church of the Anglican Communion.[3]  From 8.00 am, the public started to arrive at the grounds of Windsor Castle. The main congregation and the guests[84] all started to arrive at the chapel at 9.30 am, followed by members of the Royal Family. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were the last members of the Royal Family to depart for the ceremony, as is tradition, arriving at the chapel at 11.52 am.[85] Shortly after, Markle arrived with the party of junior attendants. She proceeded down the aisle followed by the attendants, where the Prince of Wales met her to escort her through the quire of the chapel. He accompanied her to the altar, where Prince Harry was standing.[86][87]  Prince Harry's maternal aunt, Baroness Fellowes, read a scripture lesson from The Song of Solomon in the Christian Bible. The Dean of Windsor, David Conner, conducted the service with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, performing the marriage ceremony. The sermon was delivered by The Most Reverend Michael Curry, presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church (the American member church of the Anglican Communion).[88][89] Curry's 14-minute address, which quoted Martin Luther King Jr., emphasised the redemptive property of love;[90][91] its unexpected length caused the service to overrun by eight minutes.[92] Chaplain to the Queen The Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin and Coptic Orthodox Archbishop of London Anba Angaelos offered the prayers.[93]  The marriage vows were those published in Common Worship, and included the promise to \"to love and to cherish\" each other.[94] This was sealed by the exchange of rings.[94] The wedding rings were created by Cleave and Company, with Markle's ring being fashioned out of Welsh gold and the Prince's ring made of platinum.[95] After the signing of the registers, Harry and Markle together with the guests sang the national anthem. The couple paused briefly to bow and curtsey to the Queen before walking down the aisle.[96] They were followed in procession by other members of the bridal party, and their families.[94] The couple shared a kiss on the steps outside the chapel.[97]  Music [ edit ]  Hymns sung at the wedding included Lord of All Hopefulness and Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer.[98] Prince Harry was seen wiping away a tear during the congregational singing of the latter, which was a favourite of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and was sung at her funeral in 1997;[99] it was also the opening hymn to William's wedding in 2011.  Two choirs, an orchestra, the chapel organ and fanfare trumpeters provided music for the service. The orchestra was made up of musicians from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the English Chamber Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra. In addition to the Choir of St George's Chapel, the Kingdom Choir, a gospel group led by Karen Gibson, sang \"Stand By Me\" in what was described as \"an incredible and powerful moment\".[100] The State Trumpeters of the Household Cavalry, who played a fanfare, included Kate Sandford, the first female state trumpeter at a British royal wedding.[101] The music was under the overall direction of James Vivian, the chapel's Organist and Director of Music; and the orchestra was conducted by Christopher Warren-Green.[102][103]  The bride walked down the aisle to \"Eternal source of light divine\" (from the Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne) by Handel, sung by soprano Elin Manahan Thomas, with the trumpet obbligato performed by David Blackadder.[104] Other music during the service included the motet \"If Ye Love Me\" by Thomas Tallis; the song \"Stand by Me\" by Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller and Ben E. King, arranged for choir by Mark Delisser; and \"The Lord bless you and keep you\" by John Rutter. During the signing of the register, 19-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason and the orchestra played Sicilienne attributed to Maria Theresia von Paradis, Fauré's Après un rêve, and an arrangement for cello and orchestra of Schubert's Ave Maria. For the procession, the musicians performed the Allegro from the Symphony No. 1 in B-flat major by William Boyce and \"This Little Light of Mine\" by Etta James, Jester Hairston and Harry Dixon Loes.[105]  Family celebrations [ edit ]  St George's Hall, Windsor Castle Frogmore House  Following the ceremony, there was a carriage procession through Windsor. Two receptions were held; the first, for those attending the ceremony, was hosted by the Queen and took place in St George's Hall after the carriage procession. Singer Elton John performed for the guests and the groom and the Prince of Wales each gave a speech.[62] A second reception at Frogmore House, for family and close friends and hosted by the Prince of Wales, occurred later in the day.[88] Harry drove his new wife to the reception at Frogmore in a silver blue Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero, with left-hand drive. For the evening reception, the Duchess of Sussex wore a halter-neck, open back dress by Stella McCartney and an emerald cut Aquamarine ring formerly belonging to Diana, Princess of Wales.[106][107] George Northwood was her hairstylist for the private party.[107] In a break with tradition, the bride made a speech at the event.[62] The Duke of Cambridge also gave a best man's speech. DJ Idris Elba and The Atlantic Soul Orchestra performed at the event.[108][109][110] The event ended with small fireworks displayed above Frogmore House.[111]  The wedding cake was a layered lemon and elderflower cake and decorated with peonies in shades of white and cream.[112] The cake designer Claire Ptak, based in London, was chosen in March 2018.[113]  Three official wedding photos were released. They were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski at Windsor Castle following the ceremony.[114]  Guests [ edit ]  In April 2018, it was announced that an \"official list\" of domestic and international political leaders was not required for the wedding and that Prime Minister Theresa May, Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn, and other leaders would not attend the ceremony. President of the United States Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama were also not invited.[115] This was in contrast to the wedding of Prince Harry's elder brother, which had a large number of such guests due to his position as a future monarch.[116] The decision not to invite political leaders to the wedding was taken in part because of the limitations of the venue, and also took into account Prince Harry's position as sixth in line to the throne.[116] The only politician invited was the former Prime Minister Sir John Major as he previously was \"a special guardian on legal matters to Princes William and Harry after the death of their mother\".[62]  With a smaller ceremony and reception at St George's Hall, the guest list included approximately 600 people, most of whom have a \"direct relationship\" with the couple.[117] Also, 200 close friends of the couple were invited to attend the evening reception at Frogmore House.[118] Approximately 1,200 members of the public were invited to greet the couple outside the chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle.[117] The invitees outside the chapel were \"people from charities, Windsor Castle community members, people from the royal households and the Crown Estate, and local school children\".[119]  Sarah, Duchess of York, the former wife of Prince Andrew, was invited to the wedding even though she had not been invited to the weddings of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011, Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly in 2008, or Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall in 2011. However, she was not invited to the evening reception at Frogmore House hosted by Prince Charles and was reportedly \"deeply upset\" by her omission.[120]  Amongst the non-royal guests were Markle's Suits co-stars Patrick J. Adams (with wife Troian Bellisario), Gabriel Macht (with wife Jacinda Barrett), Sarah Rafferty, Rick Hoffman, Gina Torres and Abigail Spencer, actors George Clooney (with wife Amal Clooney), Idris Elba and Tom Hardy, actresses Oprah Winfrey, Priyanka Chopra and Carey Mulligan (with husband Marcus Mumford), television host James Corden, tennis player Serena Williams (with husband Alexis Ohanian), David and Victoria Beckham, musicians Sir Elton John (with husband David Furnish), James Blunt, Joss Stone, and rugby players Jonny Wilkinson and James Haskell. Megan's close friend, stylist Jessica Mulroney (with husband Ben Mulroney) and Harry's ex-girlfriends Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy were also in attendance. Other guests were members of the Middleton family.[121][122][123][124][125]  The only foreign royal guests at the wedding were Prince Harry's friend Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, with whom he co-founded, after the death of both of their mothers, the Sentebale foundation to help AIDS-stricken orphans in Lesotho, and his wife Princess Mabereng.[126]  Gifts for guests [ edit ]  The 2,640 members of the public invited to Windsor Castle for the wedding were gifted gift bags to commemorate the event. The bag had the initials of the couple, date and venue location printed on the exterior. Inside was an order of service booklet for the wedding, a gold chocolate coin, a bottle of water, a fridge magnet, a 20% off voucher for the Windsor Castle gift shop and a tube of handbag shortbread.[127]  Charitable donations [ edit ]  In April 2018, the couple requested that, rather than sending wedding gifts, people should make a donation to one of seven charitable organisations, none of which they had a formal association with:[128][129]  CHIVA (Children's HIV Association): The small charity supports more than 1,000 young people living with HIV in the UK and Ireland.  Crisis: The national homeless body works with thousands of people a year to help rebuild their lives.  The Myna Mahila Foundation: The organisation, based in Mumbai, helps empower women through offering stable employment and breaking cultural taboos around menstrual hygiene. Myna Mahila also teaches women life skills such as maths, English and self-defence.  Scotty's Little Soldiers: The charity supports children who have lost a parent while serving in the British Armed Forces.  StreetGames: The organisation uses sport to help young people and communities become healthier and safer.  Surfers Against Sewage: The national marine conservation body works to protect oceans, beaches, waves and wildlife.  The Wilderness Foundation UK: Vulnerable teenagers from urban communities are taught about the great outdoors and rural employment opportunities.  Coverage [ edit ]  People watching the wedding at the official residence of the UK Ambassador to Italy, in Rome  Peak viewing figures of 18 million were reported in the UK.[130] About 29 million were reported to have watched in the United States, up from the 23 million Americans who watched the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.[131] The global audience was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions.[132]  Coverage of the royal wedding in the UK was shown on BBC One, ITV, Sky News, CNN (International) and E!

ABC began its coverage at 5 a.m. EDT with a special edition of Good Morning America.[143] NBC aired the ceremony at 4:30 a.m. EDT with a special edition of The Today Show.[144] The pay subscription network HBO hosted a live broadcast titled \"The Royal Wedding Live with Cord and Tish!\" starting at 7:30 a.m. EDT.[145] The parody hosts were Cord Hosenbeck and Tish Cattigan, the alter egos of former Saturday Night Live actors Will Ferrell and Molly Shannon. BBC America provided a live simulcast of BBC One's coverage, albeit with limited commercial breaks.[146]  The wedding was also aired on the Republic of Ireland's national broadcaster RTÉ.[147]  Comments in a \"posh\" British accent by a self-claimed British expert on some media turned out to be by an American, Thomas Mace-Archer-Mills.[148]  Titles [ edit ]  Traditionally, royal princes have been awarded peerages prior to their marriages; this occurred with both of Prince Harry's uncles, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex, as well as his elder brother, the Duke of Cambridge.[149] Hours before the wedding, Prince Harry was granted the titles Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton, and Baron Kilkeel, and Markle assumed the style \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex\" upon marriage.[1]  Reactions [ edit ]  British reactions to a mixed-race American marrying into the British royal family ( Voice of America  The wedding was widely reported as being significant for its departure from tradition typically associated with the Royal Family and for its inclusion of African-American culture in the service.[150][151][152][153][154] It was described as a \"landmark for African Americans\", for Black British, black and mixed-race women, and for the Royal Family itself.[155][156][157][158] Other reports cited more limited impact, including that \"Markle being biracial as opposed to African American impeded black people embracing her as one of their own\".[159][160]  The wedding, particularly Markle's choice of dress, as well as the cake and flowers, influenced the choices of other British brides for their weddings.[161]  Honeymoon [ edit ]  The couple did not leave for their honeymoon the day after their marriage, and were both scheduled to carry out public engagements in the week after the wedding.[162] The location of the honeymoon has been kept secret, although the press speculated that they might be headed to locations such as Namibia, Rwanda, and Botswana.[163][164][165]  See also [ edit ]\n",

            "text: 2018 will always be remembered as the year of Meghan Markle. The former Suits star married Prince Harry, made headlines for multiple family feuds and announced she was expecting her first child.  Other members of the British royal family, however, reached milestones in 2018. Prince William and Duchess Kate expanded their family and Princess Eugenie and her longtime love, Jack Brooksbank, walked down the aisle.

            "text: In February I saw a photo of Meghan Markle and the Duchess of Cambridge sitting next to each other at the Royal Foundation Forum, wearing colour coordinated dresses (lavender for Kate, deep purple-blue for Meghan). It wasn’t their dresses I minded, it was how they sat – legs crossed neatly at the ankle, knees pressed firmly together. It was that dulce et decorum pose passed down to generations of girls and young women expected to demonstrate their good breeding on social occasions – expected to show they are “ladies”. Both Kate and Meghan had folded their hands in their laps, the arms forming a gentle circle, the hands quietly clasped, as if ready to shelter a child or calm a kingdom’s cares. But it was the legs that haunted me – in part because I’d been taught that same bit of etiquette when I was a young black midwestern girl in the 1950s and early 60s, a child of the manners- and achievement-conscious black bourgeoisie, which in those days we called the Negro elite.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Meghan Markle and the Duchess of Cambridge at the Royal Foundation Forum. Photograph: Chris Jackson/AFP/Getty Images  In fact, things turned out better than I’d feared. In a subsequent photo Kate crossed her legs at the knee. And when both women were asked in the video about the causes they planned to take up, Meghan spoke out. The words “MeToo” and “Time’sUp” flowed from her lips. So did the words “I fundamentally disagree”, as in: “What’s interesting is … when speaking about girls’ and women’s empowerment you’ll often hear people say: ‘Well, you’re helping women find their voices,’ and I fundamentally disagree with that. Women don’t need to find a voice, they have a voice, and they need to feel empowered to use it, and people need to be encouraged to listen.”  Rachel Meghan Markle, for those who have chosen or somehow managed to miss the ceaseless chronicling of her life thus far, is the only daughter of Thomas Markle (white), an Emmy award-winning cinematographer and lighting designer, and Doria Ragland (black), a social worker and yoga instructor who focuses on community mental health. This union of white Hollywood and black social-spiritual activism made her the offspring of a modern and ever more varied biracial bourgeoisie.  The family settled in Woodland Hills, a prosperous Los Angeles neighbourhood. Prosperous and largely white: Meghan’s mother was regularly mistaken for her nanny there. This must have happened in the 80s and early 90s when she was a young girl; it still happens in the US to every black woman I know who has a mixed-race child.  Meghan’s parents divorced when she was six, and she lived with her mother after that, although she saw her father regularly. There are two half-siblings from his previous marriage, both quite a bit older. Relations with them, at least since the courtship and engagement, have been strained.  Timeline Prince Harry's relationship with Meghan Markle Show Hide  The pair meet in London through friends and begin a relationship. News breaks that the prince and Markle are dating. Kensington Palace confirms in an unprecedented statement that they are dating. The prince attacks the media over its “abuse and harassment” of his girlfriend.  Markle is spotted in London amid unconfirmed reports she is enjoying her first stay at Kensington Palace since the relationship was made public. Markle reportedly meets the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte for the first time in London.  The engagement looks set when Markle graces the cover of US magazine Vanity Fair and speaks openly about Harry for the first time, revealing: “We’re two people who are really happy and in love.” Markle makes her first appearance at an official engagement attended by the prince when she attends the Invictus Games opening ceremony in Toronto, Canada – although the pair sit about 18 seats apart. It emerges that the prince has taken Markle to meet his grandmother, the Queen, whose permission they need to marry. They met over afternoon tea at Buckingham Palace. The prince’s aides are reported to have been told to start planning for a royal wedding, with senior members of the royal family asked to look at their diaries to shortlist a series of suitable weekends in 2018. Markle is spotted in London, prompting speculation she is preparing for an engagement announcement. Clarence House announces the engagement, and the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh say they are “delighted for the couple and wish them every happiness”.  The couple marry before a celebrity-studded congregation at St George's Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle.    Markle majored in international relations and theatre at Northwestern University, Illinois. Besides becoming an actor, she became a feminist who worked for UN Women as an advocate for political participation and leadership. Yes, she has been praised and criticised as “outspoken”, but her style never risks being “aggressive” or “combative”, or any of the other words thrown at women who are deemed insufficiently graceful when they disagree with men. Even when she makes staunch political statements, her manner astutely – sometimes cloyingly – balances the forthright and the pleasing. She’s learned to use political maxims and assertions very effectively. As in: “It’s time to focus less on glass slippers and more on glass ceilings.” With the word “fairytale” now a ubiquitous tag line for the royal romance, this should be a useful daily mantra.  The Cinderella story refuses to dwindle into a period piece; in the last 20 years alone there have been six film remakes with white, black and Latina leads. But Markle has not been plucked from poverty or – like the heroines of such romcom adaptations as Pretty Woman and Maid in Manhattan – from the low-status toil and trouble of working-class life. Her net worth as an actor has been estimated at around $5m. An actor’s fortunes can fluctuate, especially when that actor is a woman. But so can the fortunes of a wife. If the royal marriage were to end in divorce, Markle would not have to depend on the Windsor millions nor, like many once-upon-a-time celebrities, design a skincare or jewellery line for QVC.  Any 'commoner' who marries into any royal family ​is seen as marrying up. But Harry is marrying up too, by marrying out  Love that results in the bride’s near magical social ascent is the key element in Cinderella tales. But is Markle automatically marrying up by marrying a prince? In the old school way, yes: any “commoner” who marries into any royal family is seen as marrying up. But Harry is marrying up too. He’s marrying up by marrying out – out of long-entwined bloodlines, out of entrenched rituals and hierarchies, out of a lineage as constricted as it is privileged. We always ascribe social ambitions to commoners, but aristocrats have their own longings for a world elsewhere. Harry is marrying into all the possibilities of postmodernity. It’s a world where – as Zora Neale Hurston said of black folktales and music – hierarchies, styles, sites of social and cultural change are being made and forgotten every day.  In this world-elsewhere that is here and now, Markle’s identities as a progressive biracial and black feminist are impeccable. When speaking of her role on TV series Suits, as the biracial lawyer with a black father, she said: “Some households may never have had a black person in their house as a guest, or someone biracial. Well, now there are a lot of us on your TV and in your home with you.” And now there are even a few of us in the castles you see on TV.  How would a global marketer for the royal family describe their marriage? Charles is not going to help the royal brand become fresh and contemporary. William and Kate are contemporary royals – unpretentious, decent and likable. But they do not suggest risk or daring. Today the House of Windsor is like a venerable and all too predictable fashion house. Its cultural currency depends on history packaged as costume drama: The Queen, The Crown, The King’s Speech, Darkest Hour. To flourish it must attract new designers, new ideas and new muses. And let me end my fashion analogy by noting that in March this year, Virgil Abloh, a Ghanaian American designer, was named artistic director of menswear for Louis Vuitton, a fashion house founded in 1854 when Queen Victoria was on the throne and the royal family had yet to be rebranded as the House of Windsor.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Prince and Markle pictured at Kensington Palace in November 2017, just after their engagement was announced. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters  ¶  Perhaps a better genre through which to read the complexities of the Meghan-Harry narrative is the romantic comedy. In the best romcoms, attraction is ignited by tension and difference. Thwarted too. The characters have to learn something from each other and something about themselves; negotiate across troublesome boundaries (gender and class privilege, temperament), and learn to take emotional risks.  For this union, Harry has had to renounce his protected status as a vivaciously shallow party boy whose transgressions took the form of booze-fuelled pranks, such as showing up at a friend’s birthday party in a Nazi desert uniform with a swastika armband (the party’s theme was “colonial and native”), or hosting a game of strip poker in a Las Vegas hotel room. Reformation followed in three stages, each appealing to a different constituency. He served in Afghanistan. He recently confessed to emotional and mental health problems that began soon after his mother’s death: a shutdown of feelings, bouts of rage and anxiety followed by psychological counselling.  Finally, there came his involvement with Markle. A professional woman, an educated woman, a 36-year-old divorced American woman, a woman of colour and a feminist whose presence in his life would soon require that he forcefully denounce racism and sexism in the British press (and, I trust, among his more un-woke friends and relations). “I’ve never wanted to be a lady who lunches – I’ve always wanted to be a woman who works,” Markle once said. In show business she worked her way up. She didn’t become a Hollywood superstar; she did become a skilled, well-paid lead in a highly rated TV series. She had a social conscience, which she acted on. And now, she is more famous and more influential than she was ever likely to be on her own. It remains the way of the world. Does Amal Clooney have more resources as a human rights lawyer and philanthropist now that she is married to George Clooney? No doubt.  Once a woman enters a royal family, every aspect and function of her body becomes a site of proprietary fantasy  Whatever we think of her new job requirements, Markle will remain a working woman with a lifetime of public performances ahead. Every word, every gesture, every detail of dress will be scrutinised and read for subtext. The touches of white on her navy J Crew coat? A tribute to the British suffragettes. Bare legs instead of tights for the engagement photos? A subtle flouting of royal dress proscriptions.  Once a woman enters a royal family, every aspect and function of her body becomes a site of proprietary fantasy. The female body as a nation’s procreative destiny: the only real change through the centuries is that fantasy has replaced realpolitik. For Diana Spencer, that meant her uncle certifying her virgin status in a tabloid newspaper interview shortly after her engagement to Charles. As if his niece’s body parts were a bride price to be flaunted, eliciting leers and cheers.  For Markle, it means media warnings that she is 36 years old and shouldn’t wait much longer. “Meghan, Oh Baby! Meghan and Harry Planning a Honeymoon Knock-Up” went one headline. Her former husband, producer Trevor Engelson, is also conjuring imaginary children. He has announced plans for a Fox comedy: “Divorce is hard,” goes its pitch. “Sharing custody is harder when an ex-wife marries a British prince. Sharing custody with the British royal family in the unforgiving spotlight of London’s tabloid media is next level.”  ¶  “Meghan Markle Looks Gorgeous With Naturally Curly Hair in Childhood.” The published photo was charming, as is the video of her at 11, with a curly frizzy ponytail, chastising the ad industry for its sexism. Many of us used to ask if we’d ever see Michelle Obama in an updated version of the afro she wore in her pre-public figure days. Many of us used to answer that the furore it would cause – the afro as proof of the first lady’s secret allegiance to white-hating black militants – probably wasn’t worth the gesture. And since a small dust-up followed Meghan’s recent appearance in a bun with wavy tendrils around her face, it’s hard alas to imagine how anything, including the claim of biographer Andrew Morton that she is a direct descendant of Robert the Bruce, would atone for a full display of those racially marked curly/wavy/frizzy locks.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Markle at her aunt’s wedding. Photograph: Mail on Sunday/Solo Syndication  But if she never wears her version of a natural, she has already done race history a real service. She has helped scuttle false, foolish constructs of “the mulatto” that were developed a few centuries ago to counter the very real threat that mixed-race people posed to the constructs of white supremacy. To serve popular culture, the female mulatto became a source of social and erotic intrigue, a figure who needed strict narrative policing. Stories, novels, plays and early films gave her two options.  She could be a scheming seductress (see Lydia Brown in DW Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation, the mistress of a gullible white abolitionist played by a panting and grimacing white actress). Or she could be tragic (as in Dion Boucicault’s The Octoroon of 1859, and Charles Chesnutt’s The House Behind the Cedars of 1900), a beautiful, seemingly white woman of faultlessly refined bearing, doomed by the taint of black ancestry. The tragic version attracts the love of a well-born young white man who does not know her secret. She tries – she hopes, she longs – to pass for white, and the ruse works for a time. But, when the innocent gentleman proposes marriage, the plot dictates that her shame be revealed and she must die, by her own hand or from a fatal disease.  Decades of scholarship and memoir have corrected and complicated this narrative, of course. Still it lingers and titillates, a handy tool for condescension, suspicion and breezy sneers. A key theme in these stories is the heroine’s terror that, if she marries her white hero, she might bear a child whose skin colour would reveal the dreaded racial truth. I imagine there’s plenty of spiteful, behind-the-scenes chatter about whether this “touch of the tarbrush” will taint Meghan and Harry’s offspring. Perhaps the “blackamoor” brooch that Princess Michael of Kent was photographed wearing on her way to a royal event with Harry and Meghan was meant to signify such a dread: Meghan as the black ewe tupped by a white ram, who will produce a shamefully black offspring.  And surely the Daily Mail was gesturing towards this when it ran a story about the ostensibly tawdry origins of Markle and her mother, titled: “Harry’s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton: Gang-scarred home of her mother revealed – so will he be dropping by for tea?” Doria Ragland was cast as “a dreadlocked African American lady from the wrong side of the tracks”. One whose career as a yoga instructor and social worker suddenly made her the equivalent of the mulatta’s disreputable mother, who gathers roots and practises hoodoo.  Early rumours had it that Ragland would walk her daughter down the aisle (with her usual dreads, I hoped). Now it’s reported that Markle’s father will, or that they will share the duty. I vote for Ragland alone. Still, to watch a divorced, interracial couple walk the royal red carpet has its own rewards when, once upon a time just 51 years ago, US law forbade their marriage.  Like any black and biracial woman, she has had a lifetime of learning to both confront and navigate codes  In 2015 Markle wrote an essay for Elle in which she quite eloquently established that she is both biracial and black. She started with the blunt racial slurs of her childhood, which turned, as she grew, into the patronising queries and assumptions favoured by adults who think themselves liberal. A perfect example was the teacher who told her to fill in “white” on a census because “that’s how you look, Meghan”. Intended as a compliment, no doubt. In the essay, she also discussed the institutional racism exposed by the police shootings in Ferguson and Baltimore. She recalled the flurry of racist tweets set off when Wendell Pierce was cast as her African American father on Suits: “Ew, she’s black? I used to think she was hot.” Then, having described both her struggles with, and her pride in, being biracial, she ended the essay with a tribute to her black ancestry.  “You create the identity you want for yourself, just as my ancestors did when they were given their freedom. Because in 1865 (which is so shatteringly recent), when slavery was abolished in the United States, former slaves had to choose a name. A surname, to be exact. Perhaps the closest thing to connecting me to my ever-complex family tree, my longing to know where I come from, and the commonality that links me to my bloodline, is the choice that my great-great-great grandfather made to start anew. He chose the last name Wisdom. He drew his own box.” Excellently done, I thought. She’s refusing to let white readers white out her black identity.  When it comes to issues of race, gender, sexuality and class, how much can Meghan Markle say and do? How much does she want to say and do? We simply don’t know yet. Like any black and biracial woman, she has had a lifetime of learning to both confront and dextrously navigate codes that range from the puzzling to the vehemently punitive. Like every actress she’s had to confront misogyny. But she has options that previous generations did not.  The speech she gave at the 2015 UN women’s conference began in rousing, declamatory mode: “I am proud to be a woman and a feminist”; moved to personal narrative (this part grounded in the story of how she organised her campaign against that sexist television ad at age 11); then built up to inspirational political exhortation. “It is said that girls with dreams become women with vision. May we empower each other to carry out this vision, because it isn’t enough to simply talk about equality, one must believe in it, and it isn’t enough to believe in it, one must work for it.” May the work recommence once the £32m wedding is done.  • On Michael Jackson by Margo Jefferson is published by Granta.\n",

            "text: It was only a matter of time. Lifetime is adapting Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's romance into a made-for-TV movie called Harry & Meghan: The Royal Love Story. Here's everything we know about the film, which is sure to be appointment viewing.  The trailers are here, and they're a little scandalous.  In the 20-second teaser above, we see not only Lifetime's take on Prince Harry's proposal and the couple's romantic vacation in Botswana, but we also catch a glimpse of them in bed.  A second, longer trailer shows their first date, and a candid conversation between Harry and his sister-in-law about his relationship. Watch it above.  Lifetime just released a behind-the-scenes look at the film.  The clip below also gives a sneak peek of how the movie will take on not only Prince Harry's party boy past but also how it will touch on Meghan's biracial identity.  It will premiere a week before the royal wedding.  Lifetime's film will debut Sunday, May 13 at 8 p.m. ET/PT, a nice lead in to the Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding date on May 19. Menhaj Huda of The Royals will direct; the script was written by Scarlett Lacey.  The film's star Parisa Fitz-Henley is a big fan of the woman she plays.  Parisa Fitz-Henley, who plays Markle in the film, posted an update about filming on March 12.  \"We are on our way to film the last scene of the last day of Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance,\" she says in the video. \"It's a really special scene, and I'm really looking forward to sharing it with you and sharing the entire movie with you. It's been such a labor of love for everyone involved, and we hope you love it too.\"    In the caption of the post, she wrote, \"I got to take a look inside the life of a woman and a relationship I quickly came to admire and claim as inspirations...So many thanks for all the wonderful encouragement! It’s been lovely to catch some of the collateral love being deservedly showered upon the real Harry & Meghan.\"    She also gave a shoutout to her Prince Harry, Murray Fraser, who plays the ginger royal in the film.  A still from the Lifetime film. Lifetime  The royal family is reportedly aware of the film, and they're less than pleased about the sex scene.  “What I’ve heard is that they’re seriously worried about the sex scene,” director Menhaj Huda told Vanity Fair. He heard it from his wife's best friend who is \"dating the press secretary of the palace.\"  But producer Merideth Finn doesn't seem to mind. “Let them worry,” she said. \"People have sex.\"  The Plot  On January 14, the network announced their plans a film which will dramatize the couple's love story \"from the moment they met after being set up by friends, through their initial courtship when they were able to keep their romance under wraps, and ultimately the intense global media attention surrounding their relationship and Meghan’s life as a divorced American actress,\" per Deadline.    The Cast  Lifetime recently released three new cast photos, giving us a peek at the actors and actresses playing the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Queen Elizabeth, and...Princess Diana (meaning yes, the late Princess will somehow appear in the movie).    Duchess Kate will be played by Laura Mitchell, while Australian actor Burgess Abernethy has been cast as Prince William. The littlest royals, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, will be portrayed by Preston Karwat and Briella Weintraub. See their family photo here:  Michael Courtney / Lifetime  Maggie Sullivun will play Queen Elizabeth, seen here drinking tea in character:  Michael Courtney / Lifetime  And Princess Diana will be portrayed by Bonnie Soper.

Getty; AP (2)  Press Association via AP Images  The 28-year-old royal cousin of Prince William and Prince Harry chose a long-sleeve, low-back design from the London-based label, which was founded in 2007 by Peter Pilotto and Christopher De Vos.  YUI MOK/AFP/Getty Images  The dress features a neckline that folds around the shoulders to a low back that drapes into a flowing full length train. The low back feature on the dress was at the request of Eugenie, who had surgery at 12 years old to correct her scoliosis.  Press Association via AP Images  “I think you can change the way beauty is, and you can show people your scars and I think it’s really special to stand up for that,” she told the U.K.’s This Morning.  Pilotto and De Vos worked with Eugenie to research previous dresses worn by members of the royal family to identify the right silhouette for her wedding.  James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock  The fabric of her gown features a number of motifs that hold particularly special meaning to Eugenie. The symbols include a thistle for Scotland, to acknowledge her and Jack’s fondness for Balmoral, a shamrock for Ireland as a reflection of her maternal family, the York rose and ivy to represent the couple’s home.  The only bit of information she revealed before her big day was that she wanted to pick a designer from her home country. “[The dress] is the one thing that I was really decisive about,” she told British Vogue. “As soon as we announced the wedding, I knew the designer, and the look, straight away. I never thought I’d be the one who knew exactly what I like, but I’ve been pretty on top of it.”  RELATED VIDEO: Celebrity Guests Arrive at Princess Eugenie’s Wedding  Unlike Kate and Meghan, however, Princes Eugenie chose not to wear a veil.

            "text: It will be a huge lifestyle change. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle pictured. Ben Birchall - WPA Pool/Getty Images  The royal wedding is (almost) upon us. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tie the knot on Saturday, about two years after they were set up on a blind date by a mutual friend.  Markle's new life will look drastically different from her life before she met her future husband. Not only will she move from the United States to the United Kingdom and become a British citizen; she'll also transition from an acting career to being full-time royalty.  In the couple's first interview after announcing their engagement, Markle, who is 36 years old, addressed her decision: \"I don't see it as giving anything up, I just see it as a change.\"  She added that she had already been working on the television series \"Suits\" for seven years. \"So we're very, very fortunate to be able to have that sort of longevity on a series and for me, once we hit the 100-episode marker, I thought, 'You know what? I have ticked this box and I feel really proud of the work I've done there and now it's time to, as you [Harry] said, work as a team with you.\"  In addition to playing Rachel Zane on \"Suits,\" Markle also appeared on the soap opera \"General Hospital.\" She's been everything from a United Nations women's advocate to a freelance calligrapher, and she recently shut down her lifestyle blog, \"The Tig.\"  While nothing will expressly prohibit Markle from acting, INSIDER's Kristin Salaky and Talia Lakritz reported that royals are forbidden from being politically active and from publicly discussing their political views.  Markle and Prince Harry say they're on the same page about wanting to change the world  Markle's experience marrying into royalty isn't something most of us can relate to. But the general theme of making big life changes for your partner is universal.  As Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg frequently tells young women, \"The most important career choice you'll make is who you marry.\"  Legendary investor Warren Buffett said much the same thing in a conversation with Bill Gates at Columbia University. He told the audience: \"The most important decision many of you will make, not all of you, will be the spouse you choose,\" since \"you will move in the direction of the people that you associate with.\"  INSEAD professor Jennifer Petriglieri said on an episode of the Harvard Business Review's podcast \"Women at Work,\" that couples, in order to maximize both partners' satisfaction, should have a conversation twice yearly about what they're \"aiming for individually and together\" in the near future.  In fact, in the post-engagement interview, Markle mentioned that she and Prince Harry had had this type of conversation on an early date: \"It was really one of the first things we connected on, it was one of the first things we started talking about when we met, was just the different things that we wanted to do in the world and how passionate we were about seeing change.\"  In the same interview, Prince Harry responded to a question about whether he feels a sense of responsibility for Markle leaving acting behind. \"Of course,\" he said, adding that, \"I still have to have some pretty frank conversations with her to say, you know what you're letting yourself in for, it's a big deal, and it's not easy for anybody.\"  Prince Harry went on: \"Whatever we have to tackle together or individually, will always be us together as a team.\"  More on the royal wedding:\n",

But, according to royal expert Katie Nicholl, there's another very important royal in Harry's life to whom he turned for advice before popping the question: his sister-in-law, Kate Middleton . \"Harry and Kate are very close, she's been like a mentor to him and he wanted her seal of approval,\" a source told Nicholl in Grazia U.K. this week.  Beyond merely giving her approval to Harry's marriage, the Duchess of Cambridge has reportedly also made an effort to take Meghan under her wing since her and Harry's relationship turned serious. \"Kate is different to Meghan in many ways, but she has made great strides to help Meghan settle in,\" the source told Nicholl. \"It's a friendship that is still slowly blossoming. Kate has gone out of her way to be friendly to Meghan, and Meghan has been very grateful for that.\"  Nicholl reports that Kate has shown Meghan \"the royal ropes ,\" introduced her to several of her favorite designers , and told the newly titled Duchess of Sussex that she's \"always welcome\" in Apartment 1A of Kensington Palace, where Kate and Prince William live with their children . \"Kate has her hands full with the children and baby, but ensures she makes time to touch base with Meghan,\" the source said.

Last year, in a profile of Harry, Newsweek 's Angela Levin noted that his sister-in-law had helped to \"fill some of that gap\" left by his mother Princess Diana's death. \"When she and William got engaged, Harry called her the big sister he never had. He often pops into their apartment at Kensington Palace, where she cooks him a meal—roast chicken is reportedly a particular favorite,\" Levin wrote.\n",

            "text: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are getting married one month from today.  Sorry, let us try that again, this time with the proper level of enthusiasm one should muster for such an announcement:  MEGHAN MARKLE AND PRINCE HARRY ARE GETTING MARRIED ONE MONTH FROM TODAY! EEEEEEK!!!!  That's better, don't you think?  But even though one month is a very small period of time until the Royal Wedding bells ring, those close to Markle reportedly think it's not small enough.  They wish the wedding were taking place tomorrow.  Because then they'd only have 24 hour left to deal what one source is describing as the ultimate Bridezilla.  Yes, this source is looking at you, Meghan Markle.  “Meghan’s driving everyone crazy with her diva demands,” an insider tells Life & Style, adding of the bride-to-be:  “She’s a perfectionist, and she’s trying to control everything going on around her.”  This is the first time we've heard of Markle being described as basically anything other than kind, generous, loyal, lovely and loving.  Aside from those racist trolls who gave Meghan and Harry problems early on in their romance due to the former's mixed heritage, Markle has received nothing but positive reviews for over a year now.  Everyone seems to adore her!  But weddings do have a way of causing such stress and tension for those prominently involved that it's nearly impossible not to snap on occasion.  And those are just regular weddings; with, like 75 to 100 guests.  Markle and Harry will be getting married in front of thousands of people lining the London streets, as well as millions more watching from home.  According to this tabloid source, the former Suits actress feels a lot of pressure to follow “the rules of royal etiquette” on her big day, but is also “worried about her family being on their best behavior.”  This last part is a bit unusual, however, because we're under the impression that almost no one from Markle's family is invited.  Just last week, Markle's controversial half-sister spoke out and complained about her lack of a wedding invite.  \"Humanitarians move forward with love and kindness especially to Family,\" Samanha Grant Tweeted about her snub, attempting to shame Markle into extending the invite.  So far, though, it has failed to work.  It is expected that Markle's parents will be in attendance, with her mom actually walking her down the aisle instead of her dad.  This is because Thomas Markle is famously shy.  He and Meghan's mother split a long time ago and Thomas now lives a very quiet life in Mexico. Sources have told The Sun that he's afraid to face the \"world’s glare\" on May 19.  But face it he will, at least in some capacity.  Just like those complaining about Markle's recent behavior, we're guessing Thomas will be happy when the wedding day comes and then goes.  What about YOU?  Are you sick of all this Royal coverage?  Or do you wish there was even more of it?\n",

            "text: From bridesmaid to bride.  With Pippa Middleton’s wedding to her hedge fund manager fiancée James Matthews scheduled for mere weeks away, we’ve put together every confirmed detail about the impending nuptials.  The date  The couple will tie the knot on May 20, 2017.  The ceremony location  The wedding ceremony is said to be an intimate moment taking place in her family’s village church of St Mark's in Englefield, Berkshire. Berkshire is located about an hour out of London and is where Pippa and Kate's parents, Carole Middleton and Michael Middleton live. St Mark's Resident priest Rev Nick Wynne-Jones will officiate the ceremony, a spokeswoman at the church has told The Telegraph.  The reception location  The reception will also be an intimate affair, held in the Middleton’s back garden. According to E!, the family home is an-acre Georgian Grade II-listed manor home. A giant glass marquee has now been erected at the back of Pippa Middleton’s family home in the lead up to her wedding, fit to host 350 guests.  The Bachelorette party  It happened back in March: Pippa chose to go skiing with sister Kate Middleton and close friends at the French resort Meribel. Pippa picked the ski destination as her choice of getaway and as this source cited to The Sun, it was a small yet super luxe getaway: “Pippa loves skiing, so it was her first choice for a hen weekend. They stayed in a really exclusive catered chalet with maids and chef, who ensured that they were totally spoilt. The owners also wanted to impress their royal guests, so the girls were showered with gifts. They were given Swatch watches, Ugg slippers, leather-bound notebooks, and bespoke fragrances. It was a very small, private party, and they had an amazing time.” Learn how to do a Hens night like Pippa here.  The wedding party  The Middleton’s 27-year-old brother James Middleton is set to join Pippa's fiancé's three siblings to form the groomsmen, according to E!. There is no confirmation yet as to who will join Pippa. Prince George and Princess Charlotte are going to be taking on the roles of pageboy and bridesmaid respectively.  The role of Kate Middleton  Back in November of last year, royal author, Judy Wade weighed in on the nuptials saying Kate will most likely not be playing any formal part in the wedding, as it would detract from her sister. Kate's name has been omitted from a list of official duties for the wedding released by Kensington Palace, which details Prince George and Princess Charlotte's roles. Royal experts are suggesting she will still play a smaller role, perhaps by giving a reading during the ceremony.  The guests  The couple has settled on 150 guests. Prince Harry is definitely attending and is bringing Meghan Markle. Pippa and Kate’s business entrepreneur brother James Middleton is attending and bringing his partner Donna Air. The groom’s reality television star brother, Spencer Matthews, who stars on Made In Chelsea, is coming, along with sister Nina Mackie. Spencer will also serve as the groom’s best man at the nuptials. Spencer’s girlfriend however, Vogue Williams, did not receive an invite. According to The Mirror, tennis star Roger Federer has confirmed he is attending the relaxed nuptials. Both the bride and groom are enthusiastic tennis fans, and Pippa has previously attended Wimbledon as a guest of Federer’s. British broadcaster Ben Fogle has also received an invite to the wedding of the year.  The wedding work-out  Middleton has been undertaking a combination of yoga, pilates, dance and spin classes at the exclusive Grace Belgravia health club in London.  The dress code  Pippa Middleton has set an interesting dress code for guests. Middleton is requesting her guests pack one outfit for the ceremony, set to take place at St Mark’s church, Englefield, Berkshire, and another outfit for the reception, which is reported to be taking place at her parents’ home.  The arrival  The Sun has reported Pippa Middleton will arrive at her wedding in a horse-drawn carriage.  The dress  Giles Deacon is the favorite after he was spotted meeting Pippa and her mother last November. “I can never really comment on rumours,” he told Hello!. “Until things are confirmed it's just rumors.” Royal experts have also picked Jenny Packham and Victoria Beckham as favourites to dress Pippa. See our dress predictions here.  The beauty look  Just four days before Pippa Middleton’s wedding, Kate Middleton's hair stylist Amanda Cook Tucker has been spotted wheeling a suitcase into Pippa's Kensington home. According to The Daily Mail, Cook Tucker has spent time inside Pippa and James's home, likely creating a wedding day look for Pippa. Duchess Kate Middleton's personal hair stylist, Cook Tucker, is known for her elaborate up-dos and so royal watchers are tipping this means she is creating one of her classic looks for Pippa on her wedding day.\n",

The 36-year-old princess and her lover Dodi Fayed , 42, were killed along with chauffeur Henri Paul when their Mercedes crashed in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris on August 31 1997.  They were being pursued by paparazzi photographers after leaving the Ritz Hotel for Mr Fayed's apartment.  In 2008, after hearing evidence over six months, an inquest jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing, saying driver Paul and the paparazzi shared the blame for the deaths.  (Image: PA)  Speaking in the BBC documentary Diana, 7 Days, Harry said: \"One of the hardest things to come to terms with is the people who chased her into the tunnel were the same people who were taking photographs of her while she was still dying on the back seat of the car.  \"And William and I know that, we've been told that numerous times by people that know that was the case.  \"She'd had quite a severe head injury but she was very much alive on the back seat.  (Image: Reuters)  (Image: Reuters)  \"And those people that caused the accident instead of helping were taking photographs of her dying on the back seat.  \"And then those photographs made their way back to newsdesks in this country.\"  (Image: PA)  No UK title ever published the sickening pictures.  Prince William added that a \"pack\" would hound and chase his mother, spitting at the royal and calling her names to get a reaction.  William told the documentary, which will be screened on Sunday, that people today would find the treatment of his mother \"utterly appalling\".  (Image: BBC)  (Image: Getty)  He added: \"We'd go looking for her to talk to, play, to do whatever, she'd be crying. And when that was the case it was to do with press.  \"She'd had a confrontation with photographers on the way to the gym, on the way outside, just trying to do day to day stuff.  \"The damage for me was being a little boy aged eight, nine, 10, whatever it was, wanting to protect your mother and finding it very difficult seeing her very upset.  (Image: Flynet Pictures)  \"About every single time she went out there'd be a pack of people waiting for her.  \"And I mean a pack, like a pack of dogs, followed her, chased her, harassed her, called her names, spat at her, tried to get a reaction to get that photograph of her lashing out, get her upset.\"  His brother said on one occasion she stopped the car on the way to the gym with the royal brothers on the back seat and confronted those pursuing her before returning crying.\n",

The series will centre around Diana and Charles' relationship  Rosamund Pike is the actress tipped to play Princess Diana in the next series of Feud, according to The Evening Standard's The Londoner column. The article also predicts that Matthew Goode, who played Lord Snowdon in The Crown, will take on the part of Prince Charles. The next installment of the series, created by American Horror Story and American Crime Story executive producer Ryan Murphy, was confirmed to be focused on Charles and Diana in April 2017. If true, this will be the Gone Girl actress' first big TV role since appearing in Women In Love in 2011.  The series will centre around Charles and Diana's relationship  READ MORE: Royal baby excitement: see Kate Middleton, Prince William, Prince Harry as babies  According to the column, the production company is yet to confirm the casting news, but filming is set to start next month. The show will address the year between Diana and Charles' divorce and her tragic death in 1997. Speaking about the new series on an industry panel last year, executive producer Ryan said: \"Having a show called Feud is interesting because...feuds are about pain. So Charles and Diana’s story literally begins with the filing of the divorce papers. And it’s about that pain, the dissolving of a fairy tale, particularly for Diana. It starts with the filing of divorce papers and takes you up until her death.\"  Rosamund Pike is tipped to play the role of Diana  Fellow executive producer Alexis Martin Woodall has also spoken out about the second season, saying it's \"a woman's story—she was 19 years old when she married him, she really had to find her own way. With Charles and Diana, they were heightened, they were royalty—true royalty—and they still had the same issues of insecurity and relevance and importance and love that everybody goes through.

One local told Vanity Fair: “It’s very clear they want to be left alone. “The property is in the middle of woodland and you wouldn’t know it was there. “It is very remote which is why they like it.

            "text: Who is Prince Harry's father? That's what many fans are asking themselves ahead of the royal wedding. There have been rumors going around that Prince Charles isn't Prince Harry's real dad, so many fans are wondering if Harry and James Hewitt are actually father and son since they look alike. Scroll down to find out!  Is Prince Harry Charles' son?  Princess Diana's ex-lover recently confirmed that Charles is Prince Harry's biological father. In a previous interview with Australia's Sunday Night, James was asked, \"Are you Harry’s father?\" from the show's host. \"No, I’m not,\" the 60-year-old candidly admitted. He was then asked why he thought the truth of Harry’s paternity has been in constant doubt over the years. \"It sells papers. It’s worse for [Harry], probably, poor chap,\" James shared.  James in 2004. (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  James and Diana previously met in 1986, two years after Harry was born (Diana welcomed Harry with Charles in September 1984). The two were introduced around the same time Charles was rumored to be having an affair with his now-wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. However, James' claims prove that Charles is actually Harry's father (Phew!).  James reflected on his and Diana's whirlwind and private romance. \"It’s a gradual period and then, you know, suddenly you can’t get enough of each other or see each other as much as you want,\" he said, adding they had some great, low-key times together. \"I’d cook and she’d wash up. Just dinner and relaxing and laughing.\"  Their affair was soon exposed by the press, which led to their eventual split. Diana and Charles — who are also parents to a 35-year-old son, Prince William — later divorced in 1996 after 15 years of marriage. Diana died in a car crash in August 1997.  While Harry has expressed in the past that he's close with his dad, the red-headed royal also had a strong bond with his late mother and recently revealed how he's keeping her legacy alive through his charity work. \"I want to do something that makes my mother proud,\" he said. \"Lucky for me I've got the prince bit so I'm able to make a difference.\"  Join our Facebook group for the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Prince William, and all things royal!

She is an actress born in California, the daughter of a yoga instructor and a former television lighting director.  But despite their different upbringings, Prince Harry and his American girlfriend Meghan Markle have more in common than we previously believed.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  A genealogical investigation by The Mail on Sunday has found that the famous pair are actually distant cousins, related through a late 15th Century ancestor of the Queen Mother.  Getty Images  The publication reports the Suits star's connection to the Royal Family comes as a result of her family's ancestry dating all the bay back to High Sheriff of County Durham Ralph Bowes - an ancestor of Markle from 15 generations ago.  Bowes' family seat was Streatlam Castle situated in the North East of England and his grandson Christopher Hussey moved to America in 1632, helping to found Nantucket, Massachusetts. Fast forward a few years and boom, Meghan Markle.  Meanwhile, Bowes's great-grandson Sir George Bowes became a member of parliament during the reign of Charles II and to cut a very long story short, Prince Harry came along.  What's more bizarre is the fact that Prince Harry's ancestor, Henry VIII, reportedly executed a relative of Markle.  A new report, via The Sunday Telegraph, claims that back when Henry VIII was reigning in Britain, there was a plot orchestrated by a man named Lord Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford and the great-great-great grandfather to Christopher Hussey (see above), to attempt to overthrow the monarch. As a result, Henry VIII had him beheaded.

A genetic survey in 2013 found that all Europeans living today are related to the same set of ancestors who lived 1,000 years ago. And you don't have to go back much further in time to to find that everyone in the world is related to each other.  Who would've though it, ey?

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Meghan Markle is reportedly 'frustrated' by the strict royal protocols that govern her new life since marrying Prince Harry .  Members of the public watching Meghan's transformation from Hollywood actress into the Duchess of Sussex could be forgiven for thinking she'd taken to her new role with ease.  She made an effortless joint engagement with the Queen to open a new bridge, attended the RAF centenary flypast, was a guest of the Irish President alongside Harry, joined sister-in-law Kate Middleton at Wimbledon and looked stunning at Prince Louis' christening.  But she is reportedly confused about aspects of royal life and the old-fashioned ways of the Windsor household.  A source told People.com how Meghan \"has found certain rules in the royal household difficult to understand, like the fact that the Queen prefers women in dresses or skirts rather than trouser suits, and is often asking Harry why things have to be done in a certain way\".  (Image: Getty)  (Image: PA)  The source added: \"I think she finds it a little frustrating at times, but this is her new life, and she has to deal with it.”  The monarchy website includes a reference to Meghan as a \"feminist\".  She had never previously shied away from voicing her opinions on issues that were close to her heart.  But protocol prohibits royal family members from expressing political opinions.  There was no greater example of this than an Irish politician's recent blunder which revealed Meghan's opinions on the country's recent referendum on legalising abortion .  (Image: WPA Pool)  Senator Catherine Noone posted on Facebook : \"A pleasure to meet Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex at the British Ambassador's Residence this evening.  \"The Duchess and I had a chat about the recent referendum result - she watched with interest and was pleased to see the result.\"  The comments suggest that Meghan may have broken royal protocol by expressing political opinon.  Since the 17th century, members of the British monarchy have been banned from doing just that, which includes voting.  But from an early age, former Suits star Meghan was politically active.  Aged just 11 she successfully campaigned to have a washing detergent advert's sexist language changed.  She also said in 2016 she would move to Canada if \"misogynistic\" Donald Trump was elected US president.\n",

Getty Images  Getty Images  Details about them, along with the fact Harry will have one, were revealed ahead of the ceremony.  As announced by the Palace this morning, the couple chose \"Cleave and Company to make their Wedding rings. Ms. Markle's ring has been fashioned from a piece of Welsh Gold, gifted by Her Majesty The Queen. Prince Harry's ring will be a Platinum Band with a textured finish. Both rings were crafted in the Cleave workshop. The rings will be carried to St George's Chapel on the day of the Wedding by The Duke of Cambridge, in his capacity as Best Man.\"  The fact Harry will have a band is remarkable as not all royal men do—though not entirely surprising. He was expected to wear his own, as a source told E! ahead of the wedding that Harry \"does want to wear a wedding band,\" unlike Prince William who \"prefers to go without [one].\"  Before the wedding, outlets speculated that Markle's ring would be yellow-gold to match her engagement band. A source additionally told E! that the ring would be made of Clogau-Welsh like Princess Diana's and Kate Middleton's bands were.  Prince Harry, during the couple's first interview after announcing their engagement, explained he chose yellow-gold for Markle's engagement ring initially \"because that's her favorite,\" and included two diamonds from his mother Princess Diana's personal collection \"to make sure she's with us on this crazy journey together.\"  Harry designed the engagement ring himself, which in addition to Diana's diamonds has a center diamond from Botswana. Court Jewelers Cleave and Company made the ring.\n",

            "text: Don’t get us wrong: There’s no truth to those rumors that Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton's relationship is rocky. The two, who are set to be sisters-in-law when Markle marries Prince Harry in May, are certainly amicable. But there’s a difference between being friendly and being inseparable.  “I think they are certainly friendly and they are spending more time with each other. You know they’re neighbors in Kensington Palace and I know that Meghan enjoys going over to see Kate and the children, and she does enjoy that. I’m told there’s always an open invitation for her to be with Kate ever when she wants,” royal expert and author of Harry: Life, Loss, and Love told InStyle. “I think that any animosity is probably a fabrication in the press. I’ve never heard to suggest that they don’t get along.”  CHRIS JACKSON/AFP/Getty Images  You’re right if you could hear the “but” coming, though.  “I do hear plenty to suggest that they’re quite different people and that have quite different interests and that Meghan is quite independent and very confident and very keen to I think establish her own network of friends over here in London,” Nicholl added.  “So that’s certainly not to say she’s snubbed Kate in any way. I think they do spend time together. But I think Meghan’s keen not to rely too much on Kate and to have her own friends as well.”  It seems that Markle certainly already has a group of good friends in London, as they were quick to throw her a lavish spa-themed bridal shower earlier in March. Middleton wasn’t present at the three-day event, but that doesn’t mean anything in terms of their relationship.  Chris Jackson/Chris Jackson/Getty Images  When the two stepped out for Markle’s first official event with Queen Elizabeth on March 12, the two exchanged very authentic-looking smiles outside of Westminster Abbey and even seemingly color-coordinated their looks.  PAUL GROVER/AFP/Getty Images  We have no doubt that they will continue to get closer over time—especially if Meghan and Harry start a family of their own. The prince said in a November interview with the BBC that they hope to start one \"in the near future.\"\n",

            "text: As you've likely heard by now, Kate Middleton is pregnant with her third child.  But could the Duchess of Cambridge be expecting a fourth child, as well?  That's the rumor floating around social media today thanks to a new report from Life & Style magazine.  The tabloid claims that Kate is pregnant with twins, and sonograms have revealed that she's expecting two girls.  A source says Will and Kate “couldn’t be happier about their double-baby news\" and have already begun picking out names.  “She’s been telling pals that she’s thrilled to be pregnant with two little princesses and has been proudly showing the sonogram to those closest to her.”  Yes, insiders claim a pair of princesses will be entering the world in 2018.  But don't expect any of that cutesy name nonsense:  “They don’t plan to coordinate the girls’ names to rhyme or start with the same letter,\" says the source.  \"Though they’re still debating the final choices, they’ve narrowed down names for the second baby, the source said: “They both like Victoria, Alice, Olivia, Alexandra, and Elizabeth.”  “One of the babies was calm and relaxed, whereas the other had endless energy,” the source adds.  “In a way, Kate feels like she got an idea of what the girls’ personalities are like! Kate jokes that the active baby is a ‘drama queen in the making.’”  The insider claims that the twins have already begun to express their different personalities:  “Kate says the chill baby is taking after George, and her sister is like Charlotte, personality-wise,” the source continued.  “But both babies have been keeping Kate awake at night, as they’re constantly hiccupping and moving around!”  We don't know why Will and Kate are bothering with all these traditional names when obviously they should dub the twins Chill Child and Princess Anxiety.  Jeez, it's like we have to think of everything for these royals!  The source adds that the whole family has been helping out around the palace as Kate prepares to welcome the new arrivals, including Meghan Markle who will marry Prince Harry in May:  “Meghan [Markle] has been by Kate’s side during the pregnancy and is always helping out,” the source reveals.  “Meghan often cooks healthy meals for Kate to ensure she’s getting all the right nutrients. She adores George and Charlotte and looks after them if Kate wants to take a nap.”  Yes, if the source is reliable, a royal wedding and two royal babies are on the horizon.  If this were a reality show, we'd say they're overdoing it!\n",

            "text: It feels like the royal wedding was just yesterday, but people are already placing bets on when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will welcome a royal baby. Markle's father, Thomas Markle, only added to the speculation when he appeared on the U.K.'s Good Morning Britain this week and said \"I don't think there is a stork in the air yet but I think it will happen sooner or later.\"    In so many ways, Meghan Markle's life as a Duchess is different from what most newlywed women experience, but in this way, it's pretty similar. While other women don't have millions of eyes watching them the way Markle does, constantly being asked if you're pregnant or trying to conceive can make a woman feel like she does.  Actress Gabrielle Union has previously stated that this isn't just a problem for women in the spotlight, like her and Markle, but for many women. \"People feel very entitled to know, 'Do you want kids?'\" Union said while promoting her book, We're Going to Need More Wine. \"A lot of people, especially people that have fertility issues, just say 'no' because that's a lot easier than being honest about whatever is actually going on. People mean so well, but they have no idea the harm or frustration it can cause.\"  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle did go on record as being team kids during their first post-interview engagement with the BBC. When asked the kid question, Prince Harry replied, \"I think eventually, one step at a time and we'll start a family in the near future.\"  That doesn't mean that it's happening right this moment.  If Meghan Markle and Prince Harry ever announce that a royal baby is on the way, we will be so happy for them, but until that day comes, we'd be happy if everyone but the couple kept the stork talk to themselves.  Planning a pregnancy is a personal, often private decision...even if you are the one of the most famous women in the world.  You might also like:\n",

While touring the campus of Northern Ireland’s next-generation science park on Friday with fiancé Prince Harry, the couple met a husband and wife team who make innovative and hypoallergenic baby products.  Pointing to the products from Shnuggle, Meghan said: “I’m sure at some point we’ll need the whole thing.”  PA Images/Sipa USA  Chris Jackson/Pool/Getty  The products on display included a baby bath that allows the baby to sit up, a changing mat and a Moses basket.  “It’s very sweet,” Meghan said.  Sinead Murphy, who founded the company with her husband Adam, told reporters, “They seemed very engaged with the products. Harry was particularly interested in the bath. I wonder if he has witnessed bath time with his nephew or niece.”  Prince Harry and Ms. Markle then visited the Belfast campus of Northern Ireland’s next generation science park, @CatalystIncHQ, to meet some of Northern Ireland's brightest young entrepreneurs and innovators. pic.twitter.com/OUgBw4FUDE — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) March 23, 2018  “As soon as he saw the bum bump [which stops the baby from slipping down] he understood immediately,” she continued. “He said, ‘Oh, non-slip.’ ”  Can’t get enough of PEOPLE’s Royals coverage?

            "text: Forget Wills and Kate's dusty old Norfolk. The lovebirds want to hang out with the groovy set in the Cotswolds - and the local estate agents' eyes are lighting up.  There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore.  And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down.  So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting.  £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains  Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month  Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills.  A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm.  'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals.  'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.'  £2million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There’s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it’s set at the end of a no-through road.  Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes.  Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area.  'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.'  However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood.  It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'.  £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier  A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home.  'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary.  'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.'  Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying £2 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings.  But sources say rather than living off his father's generosity, Harry wants to invest in a place of his own.  £4.25million - Cross Hill House, Adderbury, Oxfordshire: This 10-bedroom house, surrounded by landscaped gardens, is eight miles from Soho Farmhouse. There are ample stables in the grounds as well as a reassuringly private Victorian walled garden. The centrepiece of the house is a huge open-plan sitting and dining room  He has friends and relatives dotted across the Cotswolds, an area estate agents dub the 'Royal Triangle'.  Cousin Zara, her rugby-player husband Mike Tindall and their daughter Mia, three, live six miles from Highgrove in a cottage at Gatcombe Park, Princess Anne's country estate.  The Beckham brood, of whom the Prince is very fond, have been renovating a £5 million plot on the 4,000-acre Great Tew Estate in Chipping Norton since 2015.  Palace insiders say it's this tight-knit circle of friends that has prompted the couple to focus their search on the Cotswolds rather than Norfolk, where William and Kate rule the roost at Anmer Hall, a grand Georgian pile boasting a swimming pool and tennis court.  'They don't want to be second-runners to Kate and William,' one source says.  Locals have spotted the Prince — without his girlfriend — discreetly checking out several Cotswolds hotspots in recent months.  The blacked-out Range Rovers driven by royal protection officers have been spotted navigating the country lanes around Cirencester and Stow-on-the-Wold, while Harry has apparently been sipping pints of bitter in low-key village pubs.  £7.75million - Luckington Court, Chippenham, Wiltshire: This 11th-century house with original Tudor features is set in 157 acres of woodland and pasture, surrounded by a secure fence. There are eight bedrooms, four reception rooms, two kitchens, a music room, study and plenty of space for staff — a must for any royal retreat  'I'm not surprised he's moving here — he's in the local quite often,' says one resident. 'You'd see his security men sitting outside and you'd know he'd be in there.'  Of course, there are practical reasons for moving to the Cotswolds. Harry's royal duties require him to be close to London and Toronto-based Meghan, whose time on the U.S. TV series Suits is coming to an end, wouldn't cope well with being cut off from the metropolis.  'Harry is conscious that Norfolk would be too far out for someone with media leanings and an urban upbringing like Meghan,' a source close to the couple explains.  The couple have tested the water with two mini-breaks, in February and July, at Soho Farmhouse, the private members' club-cum-hotel in Great Tew, which has become a haven for stars who want to go under the radar.  Regulars include George and Amal Clooney, while Harry's cousins Beatrice and Eugenie were recently spotted sipping mojitos by the pool.  Luxury cabins at the farmhouse — owned by the West London club Soho House, whose consultant Markus Anderson introduced Harry and Meghan last July — cost up to £725 a night, but members say it's more likely the pair took the main farmhouse for £6,000 a night.  Meghan is said to adore the £110 brightening facials and £120 evening primrose body wraps at the on-site Cowshed spa.  £3.95million - Amberley Court, Stroud, Gloucestershire: This 17th century manor boasts eight bedrooms, six receptions, a tennis court, infinity pool, stables and a two-bedroom guest lodge. It also has 22-cares of grounds. It's eight miles from Highgrove and two miles from Gatcombe Park, and within striking distance of Beaufort Polo Club, where Harry attends charity days  Proximity to the Farmhouse, as well as Daylesford Organic, a chi-chi farm shop and bakery 15 miles away, are said to be top of Meghan's requirements for a new home.  Second on her list is plenty of outside space for her two rescue dogs, Bogart and Guy.  Harry is also said to be looking for somewhere spacious, but not big or showy, so he can keep horses and turn the land into a polo field.  'That's always been his dream,' a royal source explains.  Other must-haves are a decent kitchen — Harry is a keen chef — a helipad and a space to host parties out of reach of neighbours, passing traffic and long lenses.  The royal budget should be more than enough to secure a place that meets these requirements. Harry has a fortune in excess of £30 million. Meghan is worth around £4 million from film and TV work.  But more pressing than price is how they go about finding their dream home. Royals don't peer in estate agents' windows; well-connected chums will have been asked to do research for them.  'Harry is being discreet,' a friend says. 'This is a word-of-mouth search, with Harry's friends pulling out all the stops.'  £3.95million - Amberley Court, Stroud, Gloucestershire: This 17th century manor boasts eight bedrooms, six receptions, a tennis court, infinity pool (pictured), stables and a two-bedroom guest lodge. It also has 22-cares of grounds. It's eight miles from Highgrove and two miles from Gatcombe Park, and within striking distance of Beaufort Polo Club, where Harry attends charity days  Palace sources say VanHan, a property company founded by royal confidants Thomas van Straubenzee and Rory Penn, has been given the nod to lead the hunt.  The Mayfair firm markets some of the capital's finest properties — recently including the £39 million Bulgari Hotel penthouse — to wealthy clients.  VanHan also has access to a small roster of exclusive country piles. Viewings are strictly private and the properties are labelled 'off market' to deter prying eyes.  Sources say Harry's inner circle — Tom Inskip, whose Jamaican wedding he and Meghan attended in March; Eton pal Jake Warren; filmmaker Arthur Landon and Viscount Julian Erleigh — will be alerting contacts behind the scenes, while cousin Zara, is on hand for local advice.  Of course, there is still the tricky question of timing. Traditionally, royal couples haven't lived together until after marriage, but Kate and William set a precedent in Anglesey, spending time in their North Wales home before their wedding in 2011.  Insiders say protocol dictates Harry and Meghan should at least be engaged before moving in.  So is the house-hunt a sign that a proposal is on the cards? This week, U.S. magazines claimed the couple are already engaged, after Harry popped the question in Botswana in August.  Sources close to the couple say this may not be far from the truth, with the pair starting seriously discussing marriage — a step some are calling an 'unofficial' engagement.  But the timing of an announcement would be tricky, with so many royal anniversaries taking place, not least the Queen and Philip's 70th wedding anniversary in November.  However long they have to wait, locals are thrilled by the prospect of their new neighbours.  'The last thing we want is the world and his wife trying to get into Soho Farmhouse,' one Chipping Norton resident confides. 'You get a bit fed up of the actresses swanning around. But a prince — now, that's a real celebrity.'\n",

He has become particularly close to his new daughter-in-law, Meghan.

            "text: After the birth of Prince George and Princess Charlotte, Prince William and Kate Middleton have stirred the rumours to swing between having and not having the third baby. While the family has not cleared the air about Kate's third pregnancy, a new report suggests that there could be possibilities that the couple might not have baby number 3 and Meghan Markle is to be blamed for it.  According to a claim made by Celeb Dirty Laundry, Kate is not planning to get pregnant with her third child because she fears there will be a competition for media attention between her and Meghan once she gets married to Prince Harry. And Kate is not up for such kind of spirit.  Also Read: Prince George turns 4: Adorable photos of the Royal that perfectly capture his priceless expressions  The site wrote that since Harry and Markle are hoping to have kids some day, the \"entire world will be on Meghan Markle bump watch to see how fast she'll end up getting pregnant\" after the wedding. And Middleton doesn't want to \"compete\" with Markle for \"media attention\".  Adding to the statement, the website shared there's \"no doubt\" Middleton \"loves all the attention she gets whenever she's pregnant,\" but she is going to leave it to Markle to \"get pregnant next.\"  While the story was published on their website recently, it was not accompanied by any particular quote from the royal family. This led to Gossip Cop to reach out to find out if there was any truth in the made claim. As it turns out, CDL's claims were false.  The Gossip Cop insider debunked the claim terming the said story is \"nonsense.\" Adding to which, the website shared that the royal couple has not ruled out the prospects of having their third child.  There have been speculations that Kate Middleton and Prince William are thinking about having a third baby. The couple has joked about their plans several times and they clearly love watching the world go berserk with every hint they drop.  The recent opportunity that the couple nabbed to discuss baby number 3 was at their royal trip to Germany and Poland. Kate was gifted a stuffed bear that mimicked the sound babies hear when they are in the womb. Designed by a tech start-up in Warsaw, the gift was presented to the mother-of-two at an event in Poland. The gift immediately saw Kate turn towards Prince William and joked: \"We will just have to have more babies.\"  Do you think the royal couple should plan for the third baby?

            "text: The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom. The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3]  Announcement of engagement [ edit ]  Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the \"wave of abuse and harassment\" directed toward Markle.[5]  Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8]  The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8]  During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11]  Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17]  Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20]  Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at the Queen's Sandringham estate.[28] The official engagement photographs were taken by Alexi Lubomirski (a former assistant to Mario Testino) at Frogmore House, and were issued by Kensington Palace on 21 December 2017.[29]  To mark the wedding of Harry and Meghan, the Royal Mint produced an official UK £5 coin, showing the couple in profile.[30] In May, a set of commemorative postage stamps, featuring the couple's official engagement photographs, was issued by Royal Mail.[31]  Wedding [ edit ]  Planning [ edit ]  Preparation for wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle  Unlike the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the wedding day of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was not declared a bank holiday.[32] The wedding was on the same date as the FA Cup Final, which Prince Harry's brother William normally attends in his role as President of the Football Association.[33] Holding the royal wedding on a weekend is a break with the royal tradition of having weddings on a weekday.[34] On 12 February 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the ceremony would commence at 12:00 Midday BST.  Venue [ edit ]  The wedding took place on Saturday, 19 May 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor.[35] The chapel had previously been the venue for the weddings of Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as that of his cousin, Peter Phillips, and for the blessing of the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Harry's stepmother.[36]  Cost [ edit ]  The royal family announced that they would pay for the wedding.[37] The costs for the cake, the florist, and the catering have been estimated to be £50,000, £110,000, and £286,000 respectively,[38] and the overall cost is expected to be around £32 million.[39] The security costs are expected to be lower than those of the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.[40] The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead has reportedly spent £2.6 million on cleaning the town and roads.[40] It has been predicted that the wedding will trigger a tourism boom and boost the economy by up to £500 million.[41]  Wedding attire [ edit ]  The wedding invitations specified a dress code for men of \"Dress Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit\"; for women, \"Day Dress and Hat\".[42]  Bride and bridesmaids [ edit ]  The wedding dress was designed by the British designer Clare Waight Keller under the aegis of the fashion house Givenchy.[43] It was made of \"double-bonded silk cady cushioned by an underskirt in triple silk organza\" and had a boat neckline, long sleeves and sweeping train.[44][45] The silk veil was 16 feet (4.9 m) long and was embroidered with 55 flowers, representing the 53 countries of the Commonwealth,[44][46] as well as Wintersweet, which grows in front of Nottingham Cottage, where she and Harry live, and the California Poppy, the state flower of California.[47] It was secured by a diamond bandeau tiara, made in 1932 for Queen Mary and lent to Markle by Queen Elizabeth II.[44][48] The centre brooch had been a wedding gift from the County of Lincoln in 1893. The tiara is a platinum band, made up of eleven sections, a detachable centre brooch with interlaced opals and diamonds.[49] The shoes were also from Givenchy, and had a pointed couture design.[44]  Other ensembles worn by the bride included white gold and diamond earrings and bracelet made by Cartier.[44][48][50] Markle's hair was rolled up with \"face-framing fringe tucked behind her ears\",[51] and was done by Serge Normant.[52] Make-up artist Daniel Martin did Markle's makeup for the occasion.[51][53] The look was described as \"a soft brown eyeshadow\" with minimal makeup on the face.[51] Her nails were painted in a \"neutral pink-y beige\" for the ceremony.[54] The bride's bouquet, designed by Philippa Craddock, contained \"forget-me-nots, scented sweet peas, lily of the valley, astilbe, jasmine and astrantia, and sprigs of myrtle\".[44] The flowers were chosen by the groom who handpicked forget-me-nots in honour of his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales.[44][55] After the wedding the bridal bouquet was placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey, following royal tradition that began with the Queen Mother.[56] For the customary bridal themes of \"Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue\", Markle had her gown and veil (the \"new\"), the Queen's tiara (the \"borrowed\"), sprigs of myrtle taken from \"a plant grown from the myrtle used in the Queen's wedding bouquet\" and a piece of fabric from Diana, Princess of Wales's wedding gown (the \"old\"), and Diana's favourite flowers, forget-me-nots, in the bouquet (the \"blue\").[57][58] The young bridesmaids also wore high-waisted silk dresses designed by Clare Waight Keller which had puff sleeves.[59]  Groom, best man and page boys [ edit ]  Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge wore the frock coat uniform of the Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons) in which both were commissioned,[note 3] and Prince Harry served for 10 years, including in combat in Afghanistan.[60] The uniforms were made by Dege & Skinner, gentleman's tailors and uniform makers, of Savile Row, London.[61][62] The groom asked for and received the Queen's permission to keep his beard, as beards are only permitted under exceptional circumstances in the British Army.[60] Prince Harry wore the rank of major with the star of the Royal Victorian Order, of which he is a Knight Commander, along with the ribbons of the Royal Victorian Order, Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan, Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, and Army Air Corps wings.[63] Prince William, also with the rank of major, had EIIR cyphers on his shoulder straps and gold aiguillettes on his right shoulder (indicating his position as an aide-de-camp to the Queen), and wore the star of the Order of the Garter, the ribbons of the two jubilee medals, and his RAF wings.[61][64] The pageboys wore uniforms by Dege & Skinner that resembled the uniform of the Blues and Royals worn by the groom and best man. Each page boy had his initials on the shoulders in place of rank badges.[61]  Wedding party [ edit ]  On 26 April 2018, Kensington Palace announced that Prince Harry had selected his older brother, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, as his best man.[65][66] There was initially no confirmation as to whether Prince William would miss the FA Cup Final, which he would normally attend in his role as President of The Football Association, or if he would be able to attend both the wedding and the football. A statement from Kensington Palace that the timing of the wedding would not clash with the match was released in December 2017.[67] However, it was confirmed in March that the Duke would not be attending the final that day.[68]  There were suggestions that the bride's friend Jessica Mulroney would be her maid of honour.[69][70] In early May 2018, there was confirmation that there would be no maid of honour, and that the bridesmaids and page boys would all be children.[71] A total of ten bridesmaids and page boys were chosen, with the bride and groom each selecting five: two of Markle's godchildren, seven-year old Rylan Ritt and her six-year-old sister Remi, as well as Brian, John and Ivy Mulroney, the three children of her friend Jessica Mulroney, were chosen by the bride, while Prince Harry's nephew and niece, Prince George and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, as well as his godchildren Florence van Cutsem, Zalie Warren and Jasper Dyer, were selected by the groom.[72][73]  On 18 May 2018, Kensington Palace announced Prince Charles would accompany Markle down the aisle, after she confirmed her father, Thomas Markle Sr., would not be attending the wedding due to his recent heart surgery.[74][75] The bride spent the night before the wedding at Cliveden House along with her mother, while the groom stayed at Coworth Park Hotel with his brother.[76][77] Markle made her way to the church accompanied by her mother.[78]  Approximately 250 members of the British Armed Forces were involved in the wedding, the majority coming from units that have a connection with Prince Harry:[79]  Wedding service [ edit ]  The wedding service was conducted according to the Christian liturgy for Holy Matrimony as set out in Common Worship of the Church of England, mother Church of the Anglican Communion.[3]  From 8.00 am, the public started to arrive at the grounds of Windsor Castle. The main congregation and the guests[82] all started to arrive at the chapel at 9.30 am, followed by members of the Royal Family. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were the last members of the Royal Family to depart for the ceremony, as is tradition, arriving at the chapel at 11.52 am.[83] Shortly after, Markle arrived with the party of junior attendants. She proceeded down the aisle followed by the attendants, where the Prince of Wales met her to escort her through the quire of the chapel. He accompanied her to the altar, where Prince Harry was standing.[84][85]  Prince Harry's maternal aunt, Baroness Fellowes, read a scripture lesson from The Song of Solomon in the Christian Bible. The Dean of Windsor, David Conner, conducted the service with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, performing the marriage ceremony. The sermon was delivered by The Most Reverend Michael Curry, presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church (the American member church of the Anglican Communion).[86][87] Curry's 14-minute address, which quoted Martin Luther King Jr., emphasised the redemptive property of love;[88][89] its unexpected length caused the service to overrun by eight minutes.[90] Chaplain to the Queen The Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin and Coptic Orthodox Archbishop of London Anba Angaelos offered the prayers.[91]  The marriage vows were those published in Common Worship, and included the promise to \"to love and to cherish\" each other.[92] This was sealed by the exchange of rings.[92] The wedding rings were created by Cleave and Company, with Markle's ring being fashioned out of Welsh gold and the Prince's ring made of platinum.[93] After the signing of the registers, Harry and Markle together with the guests sang the national anthem. The couple paused briefly to bow and curtsey to the Queen before walking down the aisle.[94] They were followed in procession by other members of the bridal party, and their families.[92] The couple shared a kiss on the steps outside the chapel.[95]  Music [ edit ]  Hymns sung at the wedding included Lord of All Hopefulness and Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer.[96] Prince Harry was seen wiping away a tear during the congregational singing of the latter, which was a favourite of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and was sung at her funeral in 1997;[97] it was also the opening hymn to William's wedding in 2011.  Two choirs, an orchestra, the chapel organ and fanfare trumpeters provided music for the service. The orchestra was made up of musicians from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the English Chamber Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra. In addition to the Choir of St George's Chapel, the Kingdom Choir, a gospel group led by Karen Gibson, sang \"Stand By Me\" in what was described as \"an incredible and powerful moment\".[98] The State Trumpeters of the Household Cavalry, who played a fanfare, included Kate Sandford, the first female state trumpeter at a British royal wedding.[99] The music was under the overall direction of James Vivian, the chapel's Organist and Director of Music; and the orchestra was conducted by Christopher Warren-Green.[100][101]  The bride walked down the aisle to \"Eternal source of light divine\" (from the Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne) by Handel, sung by soprano Elin Manahan Thomas, with the trumpet obbligato performed by David Blackadder.[102] Other music during the service included the motet \"If Ye Love Me\" by Thomas Tallis; the song \"Stand by Me\" by Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller and Ben E. King, arranged for choir by Mark Delisser; and \"The Lord bless you and keep you\" by John Rutter. During the signing of the register, 19-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason and the orchestra played Sicilienne attributed to Maria Theresia von Paradis, Fauré's Après un rêve, and an arrangement for cello and orchestra of Schubert's Ave Maria. For the procession, the musicians performed the Allegro from the Symphony No. 1 in B-flat major by William Boyce and \"This Little Light of Mine\" by Etta James, Jester Hairston and Harry Dixon Loes.[103]  Family celebrations [ edit ]  St George's Hall, Windsor Castle Frogmore House  Following the ceremony, there was a carriage procession through Windsor. Two receptions were held; the first, for those attending the ceremony, was hosted by the Queen and took place in St George's Hall after the carriage procession. Singer Elton John performed for the guests and the groom and the Prince of Wales each gave a speech.[60] A second reception at Frogmore House, for family and close friends and hosted by the Prince of Wales, occurred later in the day.[86] Harry drove his new wife to the reception at Frogmore in a silver blue Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero, with left-hand drive. For the evening reception, the Duchess of Sussex wore a halter-neck, open back dress by Stella McCartney and an emerald cut Aquamarine ring formerly belonging to Diana, Princess of Wales.[104][105] George Northwood was her hairstylist for the private party.[105] In a break with tradition, the bride made a speech at the event.[60] The Duke of Cambridge also gave a best man's speech. DJ Idris Elba and The Atlantic Soul Orchestra performed at the event.[106][107][108] The event ended with small fireworks displayed above Frogmore House.[109]  The wedding cake was a layered lemon and elderflower cake and decorated with peonies in shades of white and cream.[110] The cake designer Claire Ptak, based in London, was chosen in March 2018.[111]  Three official wedding photos were released. They were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski at Windsor Castle following the ceremony.[112]  Guests [ edit ]  In April 2018, it was announced that an \"official list\" of domestic and international political leaders was not required for the wedding and that Prime Minister Theresa May, Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn, and other leaders would not attend the ceremony. President of the United States Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama were also not invited.[113] This was in contrast to the wedding of Prince Harry's elder brother, which had a large number of such guests due to his position as a future monarch.[114] The decision not to invite political leaders to the wedding was taken in part because of the limitations of the venue, and also took into account Prince Harry's position as sixth in line to the throne.[114] The only politician invited was the former Prime Minister Sir John Major as he previously was \"a special guardian on legal matters to Princes William and Harry after the death of their mother\".[60]  With a smaller ceremony and reception at St George's Hall, the guest list included approximately 600 people, most of whom have a \"direct relationship\" with the couple.[115] Also, 200 close friends of the couple were invited to attend the evening reception at Frogmore House.[116] Approximately 1,200 members of the public were invited to greet the couple outside the chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle.[115] The invitees outside the chapel were \"people from charities, Windsor Castle community members, people from the royal households and the Crown Estate, and local school children\".[117]  Sarah, Duchess of York, the former wife of Prince Andrew, was invited to the wedding even though she had not been invited to the weddings of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011, Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly in 2008, or Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall in 2011. However, she was not invited to the evening reception at Frogmore House hosted by Prince Charles and was reportedly \"deeply upset\" by her omission.[118]  Amongst the non-royal guests were Markle's Suits co-stars Patrick J. Adams (with wife Troian Bellisario), Gabriel Macht (with wife Jacinda Barrett), Sarah Rafferty, Rick Hoffman, Gina Torres and Abigail Spencer, actors George Clooney (with wife Amal Clooney), Idris Elba and Tom Hardy, actresses Oprah Winfrey, Priyanka Chopra and Carey Mulligan (with husband Marcus Mumford), television host James Corden, tennis player Serena Williams (with husband Alexis Ohanian), David and Victoria Beckham, musicians Sir Elton John (with husband David Furnish), James Blunt, Joss Stone, and rugby players Jonny Wilkinson and James Haskell. Megan's close friend, stylist Jessica Mulroney (with husband Ben Mulroney) and Harry's ex-girlfriends Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy were also in attendance. Other guests were members of the Middleton family.[119][120][121][122][123]  The only foreign royal guests at the wedding were Prince Harry's friend Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, with whom he co-founded, after the death of both of their mothers, the Sentebale foundation to help AIDS-stricken orphans in Lesotho, and his wife Princess Mabereng.[124]  Gifts for guests [ edit ]  The 2,640 members of the public invited to Windsor Castle for the wedding were gifted gift bags to commemorate the event. The bag had the initials of the couple, date and venue location printed on the exterior. Inside was an order of service booklet for the wedding, a gold chocolate coin, a bottle of water, a fridge magnet, a 20% off voucher for the Windsor Castle gift shop and a tube of handbag shortbread.[125]  Charitable donations [ edit ]  In April 2018, the couple requested that, rather than sending wedding gifts, people should make a donation to one of seven charitable organisations, none of which they had a formal association with:[126][127]  CHIVA (Children's HIV Association): The small charity supports more than 1,000 young people living with HIV in the UK and Ireland.  Crisis: The national homeless body works with thousands of people a year to help rebuild their lives.  The Myna Mahila Foundation: The organisation, based in Mumbai, helps empower women through offering stable employment and breaking cultural taboos around menstrual hygiene. Myna Mahila also teaches women life skills such as maths, English and self-defence.  Scotty's Little Soldiers: The charity supports children who have lost a parent while serving in the British Armed Forces.  StreetGames: The organisation uses sport to help young people and communities become healthier and safer.  Surfers Against Sewage: The national marine conservation body works to protect oceans, beaches, waves and wildlife.  The Wilderness Foundation UK: Vulnerable teenagers from urban communities are taught about the great outdoors and rural employment opportunities.  Coverage [ edit ]  People watching the wedding at the official residence of the UK Ambassador to Italy, in Rome  Peak viewing figures of 18 million were reported in the UK.[128] About 29 million were reported to have watched in the United States, up from the 23 million Americans who watched the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.[129] The global audience was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions.[130]  Coverage of the royal wedding in the UK was shown on BBC One, ITV, Sky News, CNN (International) and E! (Europe) [131] The wedding was also streamed live online on YouTube via the British Monarchy's official The Royal Channel.[132] Huw Edwards hosted coverage for BBC TV with Desert Island Discs host Kirsty Young and BBC Radio 2 DJ Dermot O'Leary. The BBC Radio coverage was co-hosted by Chris Evans and Scarlett Moffatt.[133] Phillip Schofield and Julie Etchingham hosted coverage for ITV.[134] Kay Burley, Anna Botting and Alastair Bruce, among others, hosted coverage for Sky.[135]  CBC broadcast the wedding in Canada with Adrienne Arsenault and retired broadcaster Peter Mansbridge presented live coverage that was simulcast on CBC Television, CBC Radio One and CBC News Network.[136] TVNZ screened it in New Zealand along with SBS and Nine in Australia.[131][137] The wedding received 4 million views in Australia.[138]  In Fiji, Fiji Television broadcast the event via BBC with coverage starting from 8:30 pm FJT on 19 May and finishing at 12:30 am on 20 May, when it switched back to normal programming.  In the United States coverage aired on CBS, NBC, ABC, E!, PBS, BBC America, TLC, FOX, and HBO.[139] CBS's coverage began at 4 a.m. EDT with CBS Presents \"The Royal Wedding\"[140] and Gayle King provided commentary during the broadcast. ABC began its coverage at 5 a.m. EDT with a special edition of Good Morning America.[141] NBC aired the ceremony at 4:30 a.m. EDT with a special edition of The Today Show.[142] The pay subscription network HBO hosted a live broadcast titled \"The Royal Wedding Live with Cord and Tish!\" starting at 7:30 a.m. EDT.[143] The parody hosts were Cord Hosenbeck and Tish Cattigan, the alter egos of former Saturday Night Live actors Will Ferrell and Molly Shannon. BBC America provided a live simulcast of BBC One's coverage, albeit with limited commercial breaks.[144]  The wedding was also aired on the Republic of Ireland's national broadcaster RTÉ.[145]  Comments in a \"posh\" British accent by a self-claimed British expert on some media turned out to be by an American, Thomas Mace-Archer-Mills.[146]  Titles [ edit ]  Traditionally, royal princes have been awarded peerages prior to their marriages; this occurred with both of Prince Harry's uncles, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex, as well as his elder brother, the Duke of Cambridge.[147] Hours before the wedding, Prince Harry was granted the titles Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton, and Baron Kilkeel, and Markle assumed the style \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex\" upon marriage.[1]  Reactions [ edit ]  British reactions to a mixed-race American marrying into the British royal family ( Voice of America  The wedding was widely reported as being significant for its departure from tradition typically associated with the Royal Family and for its inclusion of African-American culture in the service.[148][149][150][151][152] It was described as a \"landmark for African Americans\", for Black British, black and mixed-race women, and for the Royal Family itself.[153][154][155][156] Other reports cited more limited impact, including that \"Markle being biracial as opposed to African American impeded black people embracing her as one of their own\".[157][158]  The wedding, particularly Markle's choice of dress, as well as the cake and flowers, influenced the choices of other British brides for their weddings.[159]  Honeymoon [ edit ]  The couple did not leave for their honeymoon the day after their marriage, and were both scheduled to carry out public engagements in the week after the wedding.[160] The location of the honeymoon had been kept secret, although the press speculated that they might be headed to locations such as Namibia, Rwanda, and Botswana.[161][162][163]  See also [ edit ]\n",

            "text: Meghan Markle: Six reasons why she divides people — even Americans  Updated  If you thought every American would be celebrating the prospect of a Yankee taking up residence in the Royal household, you'd be mistaken.  As Prince Harry and Meghan prepared to wed, there had been an astounding level of venom aimed at both of them, on both sides of the Atlantic.  Far from being the happy, feathery event that certainly Kensington Palace and television networks hoped for, the wedding has unpacked layers of discontent among the Queen's subjects and her former subjects alike.  As Tom Wells of The Sun put it on Twitter: \"This has to be the worst build-up to a Royal wedding since Henry VIII last went down on one knee.\"  The anti-Meghan outcry has caused no level of surprise and consternation at news outlets and websites that follow the Royals, and even those that marginally mention the Royal couple.  While they value the traffic the pair have brought in, digital editors have discovered they can't leave their comments sections unchecked, or else the nastiness takes hold.  \"The most surprising thing about covering Meghan's fashion isn't the fashion at all,\" says Susan Kelley, who created What Kate Wore, the popular site tracking the Duchess of Cambridge's style, and also oversees What Meghan Wore, which features attire and activities.  \"It's been the level of animosity directed at her and the number of comments on the site and on Facebook that couldn't be published because of the tone or language.\"  Even a food writer friend who posted an innocuous \"where to watch the nuptials\" post this week was blindsided by attacks on Meghan.  She is already the most controversial British Royal bride since Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, who many people will never embrace because she succeeded Diana, Princess of Wales.  Meghan readily brings to mind the uproar over Wallis Simpson, the twice-divorced American for whom Edward VIII gave up the throne.  In retrospect, those women had it much, much easier than Meghan. In watching the Royal drama for the better part of 18 months, I've come up with a list of six objections to her marriage, led by the big one they never had to address.  1. She's bi-racial  The first, and unmistakable overtone in every conversation about her is racism. Meghan is bi-racial, and identifies herself as such. Her mother Doria is African-American. Her father Thomas is white.  This is far from unusual in public life. President Barack Obama was bi-racial, with a white mother and black father, although he identified as black.  Academy Award winning actress Halle Berry is bi-racial. Canadian rapper Drake is bi-racial. So is football star Colin Kaepernick.  Although intermarriage was outlawed in many parts of the US during the first two-thirds of the 20th century, Americans who grew up in the 1970s and after are likely to know mixed-race couples, and socialise and go to school with bi-racial kids.  For a lot of people, especially in major urban and college cities, Meghan's background would only bring on a shrug.  But, there is an old American saying that one drop of blood makes you black, and, in some of the most bigoted commenters' eyes, makes you unfit to be a princess of the United Kingdom.  Says Kelley: \"I never expected to see the sort of negative, derogatory and outright racist comments we have encountered in writing about Meghan's style.\"  This is even true when What Kate Wore runs a photo of the Duchess and Meghan at the same event, Kelley says.  Kensington Palace tried to attack this head on when Harry and Meghan were first dating in 2016. In an unprecedented statement, the Palace said: \"His girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment. Some of this has been very public — the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments.\"  Said the Palace: \"This is not a game — it is her life, and his.\"  That did little to stop the racist comments, and now Harry and Meghan face a future in which this is a day to day part of their lives.  If you think it will die down, just look at any internet post that is at all flattering to Camilla. The Diana fans are out in constant force.  2. She's divorced  But racism isn't the only thing that Meghan deals with.  The second most-frequently heard objection is that she is divorced, while Harry has never married.  The critics are conveniently forgetting that Princes Charles and Andrew are also divorced, as is Princess Anne. American first marriages still fail at a rate of 40 per cent to 50 per cent, although the British divorce rate has been dropping.  3. Unbelievably, her fashion  Commenters also have taken Meghan apart for her hairstyle, and fashionably loose-fitting clothing. It doesn't help that she's far more fashion forward than Kate, whose pristine public style often seems to have been voted on by a committee.  4. She 'dumped' her rescue dog  Fourth is an objection from animal lovers, who bemoan the fact that she left one of her aged rescue dogs behind when she moved to London from Toronto.  5. She's American  I'm putting her American nationality at fifth, although you might argue that it should rank higher. Lots of us thought that the Royal wedding might cement and repair the \"special relationship\" between the US and Britain — our best for their best.  But that theory seems as much in tatters as the current political climate. Apparently, Harry was supposed to pick a red, white and blue bride echoing the British flag, not ours.  I've seen Facebook comments from my own American friends asking, \"Why isn't Harry marrying a British girl?\"  There is plenty of sniping as well from British ex-pats who predict the marriage won't make it past five years, and accuse Meghan of being a gold digger.  6. She's a TV actress  That final critique applies to Meghan's choice of an acting career. To be honest, I've never watched Suits, save for a glimpse at an episode or two to see what she did on the show.  In an era when quality television programs have swept over the networks, cable television and streaming services, Suits remains a guilty pleasure for its viewers and a skippable one for the rest of us.  Meghan might be a talented actress, with university degrees in drama and international affairs, but she's never been showcased in the kind of TV that scoops up Emmy Awards and BAFTAs.  Would it make people feel better if Harry was instead marrying one of the better young actresses of our time, such as Emma Stone, Saoirse Ronan or Margot Robbie? Possibly.  It hasn't gone unremarked that Meghan seems all too willing to ditch her acting career for activism. She won't be like Princess Grace, who fended off many efforts to entice her back to film. For Meghan, been there, done that, now on to charity work.  But a slightly better professional resume might have quieted some of the haters. If you take all the complaints together, it adds up to one angry beehive. Says Kelley:  \"The volume of comments that couldn't be published on the blogs or that had to be deleted on the respective Facebook pages is far beyond anything I anticipated.\"  All these reasons might not matter a whit historically. Thanks to the birth of Kate and Williams' children, Harry is way down in the line of succession, so there's only a miniscule chance of a King Harry and Queen Meghan.  Thus far, the pair have managed to smile their way through every crisis that takes place, including whether Meghan's father, sadly in poor health, will walk her down the aisle.  But Meghan has married her prince at a time when the world is divided about almost everything, including her.  Unwittingly, that makes her the perfect Royal bride for our times.

            "text: Meghan Markle's Royal Wedding Look  With only four months to go until England’s next royal wedding, rumors are flying about the plans for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s union. Prince Harry (33) and Markle (36) will be tying the knot on May 19, 2018 at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle, England. While previously an American actress best known for her role as Rachel Zane in the TV drama Suits, Meghan will be joining the royal family as a British citizen. Everyone wants to know what designer and style she will pick for her wedding dress, including our team at Justin Alexander.  Due to her elegant style and refined taste, we believe that Meghan Markle is a Justin Alexander bride. The sketch below is a custom design of what we predict Meghan Markle’s wedding dress will look like.  Since Meghan Markle is marrying into the Royal family, she will likely wear something a bit more conservative with touches that embody her unique and captivating sense of style. This Justin Alexander high neck tonal beaded and embroidered lace fit and flare wedding dress is subtly sexy. The floral and heraldry motifs layered over silk tulle and silk charmeuse provide a refined elegance that is appropriate yet untraditional. Although the above sketch is a custom design, you can still mirror this royal look with gowns featured in our Justin Alexander collection.  Let these suggestions inspire you.  Justin Alexander 8918  The sabrina neckline on this gown allows for a more conservative look that is uniquely accented with chantilly lace accents.  Justin Alexander Style 8903  This style is a bit more unique, with an off the shoulder neckline and elegant sequined lace accents, but maintains the fit and flare design.  Justin Alexander Style 8905  This style's conservative sabrina neckline is elegantly balanced by pearl bearded lace laid across satin and tulle.  We'll be impatiently waiting for the broadcast of the royal wedding, and the grand reveal of Meghan Markle's wedding dress!  Topics Wedding Inspiration\n",

            "text: Back in 2011, Kate Middleton's sister, Pippa, became the world's most famous maid of honor when she attended to the Duchess of Cambridge during her wedding to Prince William. Although British weddings don't traditionally have maids of honor (instead, there's a \"chief bridesmaid\"), Kate broke custom to have her sibling by her side on her big day.    Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  So who will be Meghan Markle's Pippa on May 19? No one, actually.  Markle will not have a maid of honor at the wedding, since she could not pick one from her close group of friends. (This contradicts reports from January, which said the bride-to-be had already chosen a maid of honor.) This marks a rare The bridesmaids and page boys will all be children (including Prince George and Princess Charlotte), following British royal wedding tradition.  Though they won't be in the bridal party, Meghan's friends have still been supporting her in preparing for the royal wedding on May 19. Below are all the women we thought were in the running for the maid of honor role.  Kate Middleton  Getty Images  The Duchess of Cambridge has been giving Markle helpful advice, on everything from getting adjusted to the royal family to personal style. Despite their budding friendship, it was expected early on that Meghan would choose \"one of her closest friends who has stood by her for many years before meeting Harry,\" as a maid of honor.  Markle and Middleton only met in January 2017, The Sun reports. And though fans are excited to tout the pair as BFFs, they still have a lot of bonding to go. Royal expert Katie Nicholl told InStyle that Meghan is independent and interested in creating her own friend group in London, but not with any disrespect to Kate at all.  Plus, on a technical level, Kate \"is the future queen consort when William becomes king after his father, and would unlikely be an attending person to another royal bride,\" royal expert Marlene Koenig revealed. Middleton wasn't even a maid of honor at her own sister's wedding, so it's not a surprise she isn't one at Meghan's.  Jessica Mulroney  Getty Images  Meghan met her best friend and stylist, Jessica Mulroney, in 2011, around the time Markle moved to Toronto (Mulroney's home base) to film Suits, according to The Sun. Since then they've bonded over yoga sessions and joint vacations.

She also accompanied Meghan at the Invictus Games closing ceremony, hosted by Prince Harry, which took place in Toronto.  Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, Meghan, Jessica, and their friend Markus Anderson at the Invictus Games closing ceremony. Getty Images  Now that the couple is preparing for the wedding, Mulroney continues to offer a hand. She reportedly helped Markle choose her wedding dress designer and is also making a custom piece for the big day.  Priyanka Chopra  The Quantico actress and the Suits star first met at the ELLE Women in Television dinner in 2016. \"We bonded as actors,\" she told People of their friendship. \"We just became friends, like two girls would.\"  Since Meghan and Harry's relationship went public, Chopra has urged people to consider Markle as more than just the prince's girlfriend. She called Vanity Fair's profile of the actress \"just a little sexist\" because it mainly focused on Markle's relationship with Harry, and she shut down Wendy Williams when she described Markle as \"Prince Harry's girlfriend.\"  When Harper's BAZAAR Arabia asked her if she's going to be a bridesmaid at the royal wedding, Chopra teased, \"If you see me there, you’ll know.\"  Serena Williams  Getty Images  The star athlete first met Markle in 2014, at DIRECTV's Celebrity Beach Bowl, E! News reports. Meghan recalled in her former lifestyle site, The Tig, \"We hit it off immediately, taking pictures, laughing through the flag football game we were both playing in, and chatting not about tennis or acting, but about all the good old fashioned girly stuff. So began our friendship.\"  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  In the following years, Markle supported Williams through her matches at competitions like the U.S. Open and Wimbledon (where she actually sat a few rows away from Pippa Middleton). Williams even contributed to a few blog posts to The Tig, according to E!.  \"She quickly became a confidante I would text when I was traveling, the friend I would rally around for her tennis matches, and the down to earth chick I was able to grab lunch with just a couple weeks ago in Toronto,\" E! says Markle wrote on The Tig, describing her friendship with Williams.  \"We are both the same age, have a penchant for hot sauces, and adore fashion, but what connects us more than those things is perhaps our belief in exceeding expectations–our endless ambition,\" she added.  Though Meghan unfortunately wasn't present at Williams' nuptials to Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian in November 2017, there's still a chance the newlywed tennis champ could show up at Windsor Castle for Markle.  Sarah Rafferty or Gina Torres  Rafferty, Markle, and Torres promoting Suits Season 4 Getty Images  Markle's fellow Suits actresses may also be helping her ahead of the wedding. In August 2016, the bride-to-be posted an Instagram (which has now been deleted, like the rest of her social media accounts) dedicated to her costars, with the caption: \"Celebrating our friendship of six years and counting. So much deep love for these two women.\" The former actress also nicknamed Rafferty her \"Suits sister wife.\"  After Harry and Meghan's relationship was confirmed in November 2016, Rafferty gave a brief response in an interview with the AP. \"I don't comment on my castmates' personal lives, but of course, it's very exciting,\" she said. \"And I'm very happy for her.\"  In February 2017, tabloid site OK Magazine reported that Torres and her husband Laurence Fishburne (whom she divorced in November) had a double date with Markle and Harry.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Whether or not Rafferty and Torres are in the bridal party, we can probably expect them to be at the ceremony, since the cast of Suits has reportedly nabbed royal wedding invitations. Plus, it would be a sweet reunion for the former costars, since Meghan's final Suits episode officially aired on April 25.\n",

Prince Charles will walk Markle down the aisle  Prince Charles will walk Markle from the quire, the area of St. George’s Chapel where the clergy and choir sit, to Harry. The procession in the nave, the central part of the church, will include Markle, the Dean of Windsor and Markle’s bridesmaids and page boys.  Markle originally asked her dad, Thomas Markle Sr., to walk her down the aisle but chose her soon-to-be father-in-law after her father became unable to attend the wedding.  Markle, 36, confirmed in a statement that her dad, who lives in Mexico, will not attend the wedding due to health concerns.  Who's who in the wedding party  Markle will not have a maid of honor by her side, as she did not want to single out one of her close circle of friends, sources told ABC News.  She will though have bridesmaids and page boys, all children, by her side at her wedding.  William and Kate's children -- Prince George and Princess Charlotte -- will take center stage at the wedding as a page boy and bridesmaid, respectively.  Karwai Tang/WireImage via Getty Images  Also joining Charlotte and George in the wedding party will be the three children of Markle's best friend, entrepreneur and style adviser Jessica Mulroney.  Ivy Mulroney, 4, will serve as a bridesmaid, while her older brothers, 7-year-old twins Brian and John Mulroney, will join George as page boys.  Also serving as a page boy will be Jasper Dyer, the 6-year-old son of Harry's mentor and close friend, Capt. Mark Dyer.  Joining Charlotte and Ivy as bridesmaids will be two of Harry's goddaughters -- 3-year-old Florence van Cutsem and 2-year-old Zalie Warren -- and two of Markle's goddaughters, 7-year-old Rylan Litt and her 6-year-old sister, Remi Litt.  William will serve as best man on May 19, just as Harry served as best man at William and Kate's wedding in 2011.  George Pimentel/WireImage/Getty Images  Who will design Markle's dress?  A top contender for designing Markle's gown is the design duo behind Ralph & Russo.  Australian-born designers Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo drew the spotlight when Markle chose their jaw-dropping $75,000 gown for her engagement photos with Harry last December.  Other possibilities for the coveted design assignment have included Christopher Bailey, the visionary behind the iconic British brand Burberry, British designer Stella McCartney, Canadian designer Erdem Moralioglu, and Roland Mouret, a close friend of Markle's.  George Pimentel/WireImage/Getty Images  British designer Victoria Beckham, whose sweater Markle wore in her engagement photos with Harry, has denied she is creating Markle's dress.  \"Sadly not, but I'm sure she will look incredible in whatever she wears,\" Beckham said on the April 12th episode of CBS' \"The Late Late Show With James Corden.\"  Markle had her first fitting with the unnamed designer in January at Kensington Palace, royal reporter Omid Scobie told ABC News at the time.  Markle's mom's important role  Markle’s mom, Doria Ragland, is expected to be the only member of her family attending the wedding. She will accompany Markle by car from her overnight location to Windsor Castle on the day of the wedding.

Lady Jane Fellowes, Diana's sister, will deliver the reading at the wedding.  Both Markle and Harry have said how important it is that Harry's late mother be included in their wedding.  Anwar Hussein/Getty Images  \"I think she would be over the moon, jumping up and down, so excited for me,\" Harry said when his engagement to Markle was announced. \"But then, as I said, [she] would've probably been best friends with Meghan.\"  Markle's engagement ring features two diamonds from Diana's personal collection.  \"The little diamonds on either side are from my mother's jewelry collection to make sure that she's with us on this crazy journey together,\" Harry said in November.  Location, location, location  Harry and Markle will wed at St. George’s Chapel on the grounds of Windsor Castle, about 22 miles outside of London.  St. George's Chapel is a smaller venue than Westminster Abbey, where Prince William and Kate tied the knot in 2011, and St. Paul's Cathedral, where Prince Charles and Diana wed in 1981.  Dominic Lipinski/AFP/Getty Images  The chapel, which can seat 800 people, is where Harry was baptized in 1984. It is also where Harry's father, Prince Charles, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, held a service of prayer and dedication at the chapel in 2005 following their marriage at Guild Hall.  The last royal wedding to be held at St. George's Chapel was a decade ago, when Peter Phillips wed Autumn Kelly in May 2008, according to the chapel's website.  Where Harry and Markle will stay  The couple will stay at separate hotels on the eve of their wedding.  Harry will be joined by his best man, William, at the Dorchester Collection's Coworth Park. Markle and her mother will stay at Cliveden House Hotel, on the National Trust's Cliveden Estate, according to Kensington Palace.  Wedding day lineup  The wedding will begin at noon local time, 7 a.m., ET, on May 19.  The Right Rev. David Conner, the dean of Windsor, will conduct the wedding service. The Most Rev. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, who baptized and confirmed Markle, will officiate when the couple takes their marriage vows.  The Most Reverend Michael Bruce Curry, the 27th Presiding Bishop and Primate of The Episcopal Church, will give the address at the wedding.

Markle will also enter the chapel through the west steps, joined by some of the bridesmaids and page boys.  Following the hour-long wedding ceremony, the couple will meet in the chapel's Horseshoe Cloisterwith with 200 representatives of charities for which Harry has served as patron.  Harry and Markle plan to undertake a carriage procession that will start at St. George's Chapel, leave Windsor Castle via Castle Hill, continue along High Street through Windsor Town before returning to Windsor Castle on a route called the Long Walk.  Steve Parsons/PA Wire/PA Images  They will be waved off on their carriage ride by members of the Royal Family. The guests at the wedding service will observe the sendoff of the carriage procession.  After the carriage procession, the newlyweds will attend a lunchtime reception, hosted by Queen Elizabeth, at St. George's Hall, where they will rejoin their wedding guests.  In the evening, a smaller group of 200 guests will attend a reception hosted by Harry’s father, Prince Charles, at Frogmore House.  Frogmore House, also on the grounds of Windsor Castle, is the location Markle and Harry chose for their intimate engagement photos released by Kensington Palace in December.  Both receptions will be closed to the public but there may be a second glimpse of Markle and Harry when they depart Windsor Castle for Frogmore House in the evening.  The wedding cake's California connection  Harry and Markle selected pastry chef Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, East London, to design their wedding cake.  Ptak, like Markle, was raised in California before moving to London. Her bakery is notable for using seasonal and organic ingredients in cakes.  Ptak is creating a lemon elderflower cake with buttercream icing and fresh flowers as decorations, according to Kensington Palace.  ?? 200 Amalfi lemons  ?? 500 organic eggs from Suffolk  ?? 20kgs of butter  ?? 20kgs of flour  ?? 20kgs of sugar  ?? 10 bottles of Sandringham Elderflower Cordial The baking of the #RoyalWedding cake is under way! pic.twitter.com/b3jhwtOwOP — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 18, 2018  The choice of a lemon elderflower cake is a departure from the royal tradition of serving British fruit cake on the wedding day.  William and Kate had two cakes on their wedding day in 2011, a traditional eight-tier fruit cake created by chef Fiona Cairns and a chocolate biscuit cake from a beloved Buckingham Palace recipe.  See the gilded wedding invitations  Roughly 600 invitations to Harry and Markle's wedding have been issued, Kensington Palace announced in late March.  Victoria Jones/Pool via AP  The invitations are printed in gold and black on English card using American ink, a process that some saw as a nod to Markle's American roots.  Issued “in the name of His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales,\" each invitation is accented with gilded edges and features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales, according to Kensington Palace. The names of invited guests were added by a calligraphy printer.  Victoria Jones/Pool via AP  The invitations were produced by Barnard & Westwood, a London-based fine printers and bookbinders company that has been making royal invitations since 1985.  The man behind the camera  Harry and Markle have selected Alexi Lubomirski to be the official photographer at their wedding.  PA Wire/AP  Lubomirski, a renowned portrait and fashion photographer, will take the official photographs at Windsor Castle following Harry and Markle's wedding at St George's Chapel.  Lubomirski is a former assistant to Mario Testino, who was a favorite photographer of Harry's mother, the late Princess Diana.  He was also selected by Harry and Markle to take their engagement photos at Frogmore House, Windsor, that were released by Kensington Palace in December.  Markle's favorite bloom in the wedding flowers  The wedding floral displays in St. George's Chapel will include white garden roses foxgloves and peonies, Markle’s favorite bloom, as well as local branches of beech, birch, and hornbeam.  Markle and Harry have chosen Philippa Craddock to design the flowers for both the church service at St. George’s Chapel and the wedding reception at St. George’s Hall hosted by Queen Elizabeth.  Craddock, based in Fulham, is one of the most notable florists in London, with clients including Kensington Palace, Hampton Court Palace, Alexander McQueen, Christian Dior, the Victoria and Albert Museum and British Vogue.  Where possible, Philippa will use flowers and plants that are in season and blooming naturally in May, including branches of beech, birch and hornbeam, as well as white garden roses, peonies and foxgloves. — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) April 1, 2018  The flowers -- which will also include locally-sourced foliage from areas around Windsor Castle -- will be donated to various charities after the wedding, according to Kensington Palace.  The soundtrack of the wedding  Harry and Markle's wedding day will be illuminated by the sounds of a gospel choir, an organ, trumpets, a full orchestra, a soprano and a 19-year-old cellist who was personally asked by Markle.  \"I was bowled over when Ms. Markle called me to ask if I would play during the ceremony,\" Sheku Kanneh-Mason said in a statement released by Kensington Palace. \"And of course I immediately said yes. What a privilege to be able to play the cello at such a wonderful event. I can’t wait!”  19-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, winner of 2016 @BBCYoungMus. Last June, Prince Harry saw Sheku play at an event in London in support of the work of Antiguan charity the Halo Foundation. pic.twitter.com/C3QSfcbXJl — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) April 24, 2018  The music during the wedding ceremony will be under the direction of St. George's Chapel's director of music, James Vivian, and will also include the choir of St. George's Chapel, according to Kensington Palace.  The entire ceremony will also be recorded live and released on Decca Records, a U.K.-based records label. The album, which will include a collector's booklet, will go on sale around the world on May 25, according to Decca Records.  Harry and Markle's horse-drawn royal carriage  The newlyweds will travel through Windsor Town and along the Long Walk in the Ascot Landau carriage.  The carriage, which will be pulled by Windsor Grey horses, is one of five Ascot Landaus used by the royal family. Two of the Ascot Landaus were used at William and Kate's 2011 wedding, including carrying Harry in his role as best man.  Take a closer look at the Ascot Landau carriage, which will take Prince Harry and Ms. Markle on a procession through Windsor Town after their wedding. pic.twitter.com/pXHg2tIjKS — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 2, 2018  The most celeb-studded royal wedding to date?  Among the high-profile guests who could attend Harry and Markle's wedding are some of Markle's celebrity friends, including actress Priyanka Chopra and tennis star Serena Williams.  Getty Images  Former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama will not be at the wedding at Windsor Castle, despite speculation they would attend. It is unclear whether the Obamas received an invitation but declined to avoid a political distraction.  Markle and Harry decided against inviting political leaders from the U.K. and abroad to their wedding, meaning President Donald Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May will not attend.  Markle has though invited several members of the cast of \"Suits,\" the TV show she starred on for seven seasons, ABC News has learned. Also expected to attend the wedding ceremony is Elton John, one of Diana’s closest friends who has worked with Harry on AIDs policy.  Singers Ed Sheeran and Rihanna and members of Coldplay, who have all actively supported Harry's charitable work, could also get invites.  Spice Girls star Mel B said on a talk show in February that all five Spice Girls have been invited to Harry and Markle's wedding.  Stefan Wermuth/Reuters, FILE  Mel B declined to comment on whether the Spice Girls would perform on the big day, saying, \"You’re going to get me fired! Let’s not talk about it anymore! Let’s pretend that I never said that.”  Other members of the girl band have since indicated they will not be performing.  Prince William and Princess Kate invited Ellie Goulding to perform at their wedding reception in 2011.  Everyday people will play a role  Harry and Markle have invited 2,640 people onto the grounds of Windsor Castle to see the wedding carriage procession as it departs.  Matt Dunham/AP  Members of the public were selected from different regions of the U.K. with a special emphasis on those who have served their community. The couple also invited 100 students from two local schools in Windsor that have a strong affiliation with Windsor Castle.  Harry and Markle also extended invitations to 200 individuals who take part in charities and organizations for which Harry serves as royal patron.  Armed Forces will play a role too  More than 250 members of the Armed Forces will provide ceremonial support at both the wedding and the carriage procession, according to the U.K. Ministry of Defense.  \"Members of the Household Cavalry will form a staircase party at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle as part of the wedding,\" the statement reads. \"The State Trumpeters and a Captain’s Escort from the Household Cavalry will also provide ceremonial support.\"  The members will come from British Armed Forces units with a “special relationship” to Harry, a veteran. Harry served two tours of duty in Afghanistan and rose to the rank of Captain during his time in the military.  Prince Harry and Ms. Markle are pleased that members of the Armed Forces will play such a special role in their Wedding. The Military, and these units in particular, hold a great significance for Prince Harry and the couple are incredibly grateful for their support. — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) March 28, 2018  Is Markle planning this all on her own?  Markle's best friend and stylist, Jessica Mulroney, is also a bridal planner and assisting Markle in the entire design and concept of the wedding party outfits and look for the reception.  George Pimentel/Getty Images  Mulroney is Canada’s best-known stylist who styled Markle during her seven-season run on the TV drama \"Suits,\" which films in Toronto.  Since Markle's engagement to Harry, Mulroney helped select the dress and coat Markle wore on the day the couple's engagement was announced in November. Mulroney was also at Markle's side advising her on the gown and sweater Markle wore for her intimate engagement photos with Harry.  Mulroney is the wife of Ben Mulroney, whose father is a former prime minister of Canada. The two are one of Canada's best-known power couples and are often considered Canadian royalty in Toronto.  Who is paying for this celebration?  Kensington Palace confirmed in a statement released after the couple’s engagement that Harry’s family would pay for the “core aspects of the wedding.”  \"As was the case with the wedding of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, The Royal Family will pay for the core aspects of the wedding, such as the church service, the associated music, flowers, decorations, and the reception afterwards,” the statement read.  Markle is expected to pay for her wedding dress. Security costs for the wedding day will come at the expense of U.K. taxpayers.  Queen Elizabeth gives handwritten, formal consent  Buckingham Palace shared an image of the handwritten Instrument of Consent. According to the Succession to the Crown Act of 2013, the first six people in line to the throne must obtain the consent of the Queen before marrying.

It also features Prince Harry’s label, including three tiny red escallops from the Spencer family arms,\" according to Buckingham Palace.  To the right of the text is a rose, which is the national flower of the United States, and two golden poppies, the state flower of California where Markle was born.

The document also incorporates the coronet for Harry.  The honeymoon will be delayed  Harry and Markle will delay their honeymoon and do a public engagement the week after the wedding.  The newlyweds will attend Prince Charles's 70th birthday patronage celebration at Buckingham Palace on May 22, just days after their wedding.  Markle and Harry will take a honeymoon sometime thereafter, before resuming a busy schedule of engagements for the rest of the year.

But they both think that when the moment feels right, that will be the time to go for it.”  How long should they wait to have kids? Experts say factors to evaluate before having children include their ages and the stability of the reationship. With the happy couple being in their mid-Thirties, science suggests they should get going now, as they seem to be doing.

            "text: The Line of Succession to the British Throne  Who will be the next King or Queen?  HRH Prince Charles, The Prince of Wales  Prince Charles is presently heir (next in line) to the British throne. He will not become king until his mother, Queen Elizabeth, abdicates (gives up the throne), retires or dies. When either of these happen, Prince Charles may abdicate and pass the throne to his eldest son Prince William. What is the title of the heir to the British throne? The heir to the throne is always called the Prince of Wales. The title was introduced by King Edward l in 1301, after the conquest of Wales. If the eldest child of the monarch is female, will she become heir to the throne? Yes, if she does not have any brothers. No, if she has a brother. In Britain the crown was normally passed from monarch to eldest son. As King George VI had no son, it passed to his elder daughter, now Queen Elizabeth II. If a monarch had sons, they took precedence over daughters: thus, although HR The Princess Royal is older than her brothers HRH The Duke of York and HRH The Earl of Wessex, they (and their children) precede her in the order of succession. From 2013, this all changes. Now the oldest child in herit the throne regardless of being a daughter or a son. This means that if William and Kate had had a daughter she would have inherited the throne even if she had a younger brother. The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 Succession to the Crown not to depend on gender  In determining the succession to the Crown, the gender of a person born after 28 October 2011 does not give that person, or that person's descendants, precedence over any other person (whenever born). Who can be heir to the British throne? Up until 2013, the succession in the United Kingdom was governed by the Act of Union 1800, which restated the provisions of the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Bill of Rights (1689). Pre 2013 'Only Protestant heirs of Princess Sophia, granddaughter of James I, may succeed to the British throne. Neither Catholics, nor those who marry a Catholic, nor those born out of wedlock, may remain in the line of succession.' The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 2. Removal of disqualification arising from marriage to a Roman Catholic  A person is not disqualified from succeeding to the Crown or from possessing it as a result of marrying a person of the Roman Catholic faith.  The current Royal Line of Succession is:  (see also the Royal Family Tree ) HRH The Prince Charles, The Prince of Wales (1948), eldest son of HM Queen Elizabeth II HRH Prince William of Wales (1982), elder son of HRH The Prince Charles, The Prince of Wales Prince George of Cambridge (b 2013), son of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge  HRH Prince Henry of Wales (popularly referred to as Prince Harry), (1984), younger son of HRH The Prince Charles, The Prince of Wales HRH The Prince Andrew, The Duke of York (1960), second son of HM Queen Elizabeth II HRH Princess Beatrice of York (1988), elder daughter of HRH The Prince Andrew, The Duke of York HRH Princess Eugenie of York (1990), younger daughter of HRH The Prince Andrew, The Duke of York HRH The Prince Edward, The Earl of Wessex (1964), youngest son of HM Queen Elizabeth II James Windsor, Viscount Severn (2007), son of HRH The Prince Edward, The Earl of Wessex Lady Louise Windsor (2003), daughter of HRH The Prince Edward, The Earl of Wessex HRH The Princess Anne, The Princess Royal (1950), only daughter of HM Queen Elizabeth II Peter Phillips (1977), son of HRH The Princess Anne, The Princess Royal Zara Phillips (1981), daughter of HRH The Princess Anne, The Princess Royal David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley (1961), son of HRH The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon The Honourable Charles Armstrong-Jones (1999), son of David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley The Honourable Margarita Armstrong-Jones (2002), daughter of David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley Lady Sarah Chatto (1964), daughter of HRH The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon Samuel Chatto (1996), son of Lady Sarah Chatto Arthur Chatto (1999), son of Lady Sarah Chatto HRH Prince Richard, The Duke of Gloucester (1944), son of HRH The Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, 3rd son of HM King George V  Royal Family Tree\n",

            "text: |  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had their \"first fight\" over a prenup, reveals OK!. The engaged couple is moving ahead with wedding planning, but has hit a major hurdle, according to the story.  The magazine reports that Queen Elizabeth has seen \"too many royal marriages end in divorce\" and doesn't want her grandson to \"take any chances with his reported $40 million fortune.\" That's led to tension between the spouses-to-be, with a source sharing, \"Meghan can see where the queen is coming from, but at the same time, she's insulted that it would even cross the queen's mind that Meghan would have an ulterior motive for marrying Harry.\"  The actress \"loves Harry, and money is the last thing on her mind,\" relates the insider. But Queen Elizabeth is nonetheless pressuring her heir to make sure the family's money is protected, explains the publication. Consequently, the outlet says that means Prince Harry and Markle are clashing over the situation.  It is true there have been a number of divorces across the monarchy over the years, but no one has ever laid claim to royal possessions and there's no evidence that a British royal has ever signed a prenuptial agreement. As such, Gossip Cop is told this \"first fight\" tale is entirely \"untrue.\" Tellingly, it also comes from the same tabloid that falsely claimed Markle was pregnant in October.\n",

            "text: Getty  In Touch adds that both duchesses, 36, are preparing to raise the royal cousins together.  The insider spilled, 'Kate and Meghan bonded over the men they married. Now they're bonding over being pregnant together.'  Despite the two wanting to share the exciting news with the world, In Touch's bombshell report reveals the two women have only disclosed to friends and family.  Related: Kate Middleton and Prince William expecting fourth child  Related: Meghan and Harry's twin joy  Getty  On top of the exciting news, Meghan feels an 'enormous relief.'  'She was a nervous wreck about conceiving,' a palace insider says, not only because of her age but 'because it didn't happen with her first husband,' producer Trevor Engelson, from whom she split in 2013 after two years of marriage and nine years as a couple.  The pressure to give husband, Prince Harry, children 'felt like a huge weight on Meghan's shoulders,' says the source.  'Everyone expected her to get pregnant immediately.'  Meanwhile Prince William, 36, was 'initially shocked when Kate told him he's going to be a dad again', but now he sees it as a 'happy surprise.'  'He and Kate have always wanted four kids,' the source tells.  And this time around, adds the source, Kate gets to share her pregnancy journey with not only her young sister Pippa, 34, who is due with her first child in a few months, but her new sister-in-law, too.  Getty  The source adds that Kate is 'convinced she's having another girl because she's having the same cravings for sweets that she did when she was pregnant with Charlotte.'  Meghan is hoping for one of each - a boy and a girl - the insider tells In Touch.  'This is a dream come true for both couples.'  The royal family is yet to respond to In Touch's report.\n",

            "text: God save Meghan Markle! The Duchess Of Sussex has run into some issues when it comes to her royal behavior, but she has her husband Prince Harry to support her through it!  Meghan Markle was just accused of breaking royal protocol and “disrespecting the Queen” when she crossed her legs at a royal engagement. Shortly after, she attempted to hold Prince Harry’s hand in public — which just isn’t what the royals do. Still, she’s only been a Duchess for a month and a half, so the Royal Family is cutting her some slack, even though she’s incredibly hard on herself. “Meghan does worry about messing up, she worries terribly, because she wants to do everything perfectly, so she really beats herself up when she gets even the tiniest thing wrong. But, there is so much to remember, so many minuscule little details, it’s kind of mind-blowing really–and all incredibly high pressured too, as it’s all under a microscope at the same time,” a palace insider told HollywoodLife.com exclusively.  “The funny thing is that the Queen is actually incredibly gracious to Meghan, she doesn’t put any pressure on her at all, it’s actually quite the opposite, and Harry is so loving and supportive, he’s constantly telling Meghan how amazing she’s doing, and how quickly she’s learning, and she is!” Aww! Listen, if the Queen doesn’t have a problem, we don’t have a problem.  At Meghan and Harry’s royal nuptials on May 18, the duchess seemed ready to commit to her role as a royal — singing God Save The Queen flawlessly, and crossing her legs at her ankles. Her few faux pas, while understandable to the royal family, are reportedly devastating to her. “The British press is constantly jumping on each and every little faux pas though, and publicly reprimanding Meghan, it’s horrible really, and some days she ends up in tears,” the insider revealed. “Harry is so protective of Meghan, and he hates how some of the newspapers write about her, it reminds him of his mother, and the way she was treated by the press, and sometimes Harry worries that nothing has really changed.” Recall, the British tabloids were incredibly tough on Princess Diana, but if Meghan is anything like her she’ll continue to handle herself with impeccable class!\n",

            "text: Samantha, 53, is intent on telling all, including dirt about the Markle family. She revealed: “Everyone will just have to read it to see what really goes on in the shadows. “My book is much more comprehensive as it definitely takes an in-depth look. (It is an) in-depth look at the unspoken dynamics through and beyond the wedding.” She then promised readers that “opening the book and reading it puts a spotlight on the shadows.”  She has changed the title of her book, which was once called ‘The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister’, to ‘In The Shadows of The Duchess’. Samantha lives in Florida and has not seen Meghan in over a decade, but is nevertheless quick to criticise the Duchess. Samantha’s latest reveal comes after she dubbed the Duchess of Sussex - who married Prince Harry in Windsor on May 19 – the “Duchess of Nonsense” earlier this month. Ms Markle claimed Prince Harry should have married his ex-girlfriend, Cressida Bonas – and claimed that his mother, the late Princess of Wales, would be “ashamed”.  Meghan Markle half-sister: Samantha Markle has appeared on TV numerous times to discuss Meghan  Taking to Twitter she wrote: “Harry is a wuss to allow the Duchess of Nonsense to mistreat everyone who has been close to her, especially her family. “Diana would be ashamed. Stop wearing Meg’s skivvies and bra and take your pants off her.” Samantha has been called “a little vulture” by Piers Morgan live on Good Morning Britain after she slated the new Duchess. Meghan and Samantha’s father Thomas Markle, a retired lighting director who lives in Mexico, did not attend the royal wedding ay Windsor Castle, reportedly after a heart attack just days before the event.

Chris Rock tweeted a controversial joke about Lamar Odom's recent stay at the Love Ranch South brothel — and subsequent hospitalization — and how the crisis saved his marriage to Khloe Kardashian.  PHOTOS: Khloe and Lamar's wedding album  On Thursday, Oct. 22, Rock, 50, shared a meme with his 3.5 million-plus followers on Twitter of a married couple bickering in their kitchen. The caption of the graphic read, \"Here's to Lamar Odom on being the first guy in history to have coke and hookers save his marriage.\"  The comedian, who was also announced as the 2016 Oscars host this week, then added: \"Stay strong Lamar.\"  PHOTOS: Khloe's evolution  While some fans found the joke funny, others called it offensive. \"Too soon. shame on you, Rock,\" one person tweeted, while another wrote: \"savage.\"  Odom was found unconscious on Tuesday, Oct. 13, at the legal brothel in Pahrump, Nev., where authorities later confirmed that Odom had taken herbal Viagra, and used drugs that Saturday when he first checked in. After the troubled NBA player was first hospitalized, his estranged wife, Kardashian, rushed to be by his side and faced difficult medical decisions on his behalf while he was unconscious for nearly 72 hours.  PHOTOS: Reality TV tragedies  Odom was discharged from Sunrise Hospital this past Monday, and transported via helicopter to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in L.A., where he is currently being monitored by top medical personnel.  Us Weekly confirmed this past Wednesday, Oct. 21, that Kardashian's lawyer Laura Wasser asked a judge to withdraw the couple's divorce filing, which was signed by both parties in July. At the time, the documents were still pending and awaiting the final sign-off from the court. Kris Jenner subsequently confirmed that the divorce was called off. \"Nothing but love,\" the Kardashian family matriarch told her longtime pal Billy Bush.  PHOTOS: Kardashian Christmas cards through the years  While many fans have been ecstatic that Kardashian, 31, and Odom, 35, are giving their marriage a second shot, Rock's Twitter joke, however, may have been posted too soon. TMZ reported late Thursday night that Odom had undergone two emergency surgeries, shortly after Us confirmed that the former Lakers player was \"not out of the woods.\"  Best and Worst Celeb Halloween Costumes of All Time!

The portrait of Kardashian, which was on display at the De Re Gallery in West Hollywood as part of Smith's \"Metallic Life\" exhibit, is a monochromatic photo that features the reality star's naked backside. The mom of three, 36, happily posed beside the artwork alongside Smith, whose work was also recently published on Vanity Fair's website.

Lamar Odom Overdosed on Cocaine and Other Drugs: Report  Authorities suspect that Lamar Odom overdosed on cocaine and other drugs before he was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel earlier this month, the Associated Press reports.

In addition, Eisenloffel said onlookers claimed that the former NBA star ingested \"an unknown substance in the form of an unidentified pill, which he obtained from his pocket,\" and prostitutes \"heard him snorting.\"  PHOTOS: Khloe and Lamar's wedding album  TMZ reported on Thursday that Khloe Kardashian's husband, 35 — the pair have decided to dismiss their divorce case — underwent two emergency surgeries at L.A.'s Cedars-Sinai Hospital. Visitors have reportedly been banned, but Kardashian, 31, continues to remain by his side.  \"This is a huge wakeup call for Lamar, for his friends and family,\" a source told Us. \"Everyone is just really hoping for the best.\"  PHOTOS: Celebrity health scares  As previously reported, the Kardashian-Jenner clan visited Odom at Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas before he was transferred to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in L.A. on Monday.

Dr. Drew Talks Teen Mom 2's Leah Messer: \"I Was Expecting Progress\"  Following reports that Leah Messer lost primary custody of her twins, Ali and Aleeah, Dr. Drew Pinsky, who moderates the Teen Mom 2 reunion specials, spoke out about the West Virginia native.  PHOTOS: Leah Messer's family album  Admitting he could not confirm the reports, the addiction specialist, 57, spoke about Messer in a backstage interview on The Rachael Ray Show.  “She is a dedicated mother,” he said. “If you saw the last reunion show, which is the last time I had contact with her, I believed she was making some progress.”  PHOTOS: Teen Mom stars, then and now  Though the reunion special, which was taped in July and aired earlier this month, featured a tense confrontation between Messer and her ex-husband Corey Simms and his wife, Miranda, Dr. Drew didn’t think that was cause for concern.  “People around her were starting to really come down on her,” he noted. “When that starts to happen, that’s a real sign that the identified patient — whatever her condition is, mental health issue — is getting better. When somebody is aware enough that the people who have been so worried and frustrated around them can actually hear them that’s when they come down on them. So I told Leah that I thought that was a good sign and she should learn to tolerate it.”  PHOTOS: Stars battling mental health issues  The custody battle between Messer and Simms, which has been closely documented on Teen Mom 2, was ugly throughout Season 6. Simms accused his ex-wife of having a pill addiction and endangering their daughters. (Messer is also mom to daughter Addie with her ex-husband Jeremy Calvert.)  Messer has never admitted to a drug addiction and passed a court-ordered drug test on the show. In June she went to a rehabilitation facility for 30 days for treatment for depression. On the reunion special, Dr. Drew also alluded to the fact that Messer’s mental illness had led to a previously undisclosed hospitalization.  PHOTOS: Stars who have been to rehab  “I was expecting progress,” Dr. Drew said on Rachael Ray. “I certainly wish her the best. She is working very hard. It’s been a terribly painful and stressful time for her.”  Neither Messer nor Simms have confirmed the reports about the new custody arrangement.

Caitlyn Jenner Wears Kate Middleton's Engagement Dress: Who Wore It Best  There are some fashion moments we'll remember forever. One of them happens to be the navy blue Issa London wrap dress that Kate Middleton wore for her engagement announcement to Prince William.  PHOTOS: The royal wedding album  Back in 2010, the Duchess of Cambridge, now 33, paired the shiny V-neck frock with a dainty necklace, sensible black pumps, and, of course, her matching sapphire engagement ring. With the \"Kate Effect\" in full swing, the dress reportedly sold out within 24 hours of her wearing it.  PHOTOS: Kate Middleton's recycled dresses  However, it's clearly back in stock. On Wednesday, Oct. 21, the Issa London \"Phylis\" style resurfaced in L.A. on Caitlyn Jenner. The I Am Cait star, 65, whose own style is focused on ladylike wrap dresses and cozy sweaters, took a cue from Middleton, pairing her version of the knee-length number with similar black heels, this time in a sling-back style. Jenner carried a matching black handbag, and accessorized with simple stud earrings and a chain-link bracelet. The only difference between the two dresses is that the former Olympian wore the wrapped ties as a bow in the front, while Middleton tied her dress in the back.

The physician passed away from natural causes in Palm Springs, Fla., on Thursday, Oct. 22. He was 70.  PHOTOS: Stars gone too soon  According to TMZ, Klein admitted himself into a hospital earlier this week when he was feeling abdominal pains. He was wheelchair-bound and also suffered from multiple sclerosis.  The L.A.-based dermatologist treated the late Jackson for several years until the legendary singer's death in 2009. Over time, he's continued to dodge questions of rumors that he's the biological father of Jackson's two oldest children, Prince, 18, and Paris, 17.  Back in 2009, Klein admitted during Larry King Live that he once donated sperm, but only to a bank. \"Here's the most important thing. Michael loved those children. Those children loved him as a father,\" he told King at the time. \"As far as I am concerned, that's the most important grouping there is.\"  PHOTOS: Celebrity deaths 2015  \"That's not answering the question,\" King replied. Klein quipped back: \"No, because I'm not going to answer it the way you want me to answer it because…I will say no if that's what you want to hear.\" (Klein has never denied that he's the dad.)

PHOTOS: Prince George's baby album  At the theatre, the mother of Prince George and Princess Charlotte was intrigued by an 8-year-old girl named Evie Will who was wearing a mask of Queen Elizabeth.  “Where did you find that?” she asked the little girl, laughing.  Little Evie later opened up to Us Weekly and other reporters about meeting Prince William, saying, “He was asking me what I like at school and what productions I have seen at the theatre, and I said I like maths and I've seen James and the Giant Peach and the BFG. He said that he didn't like maths. It was cool to meet them, but I was kind of scared.\"  PHOTOS: Kate Middleton's recycled outfits  One well-wisher asked the Duchess if William was still a fan of his motorbike.  \"He's still riding it,” she replied. “It always fills me with horror when he goes out on it. I'm terrified… ? Hopefully, I'm going to keep George off it.\"  Amanda Lowsen, the Community and Wellbeing Facilitator at the theatre, noted of the Royals, \"They were very relaxed. A lot of the mums were saying it's great to come to something all together as a family and they were nodding and seemed to understand that.\"  William and Kate later visited The Corner, a drop-in center for teens wanting advice on issues like contraception or exam stress, and then joined in an anti-bullying workshop organized by Scottish organization, RespectMe.  Mila Kunis: I'd Bury a Body for My Baby Daughter Wyatt  Too funny! Mila Kunis loves her baby girl, Wyatt, so much that she would personally help bury the body if her daughter killed someone, the actress said on Thursday, Oct. 22.  “I think if she killed someone, I would literally be like, ‘I got it,’” Kunis, 32, told Business Insider of her 12-month-old daughter. “‘Where do you want me to bury the body?’ I wouldn’t even question it. I can’t say that about anybody else in my life.”  PHOTOS: Mila's pregnancy style  Kunis, who married Ashton Kutcher this past July, shared additional details about how motherhood has changed her.  PHOTOS: Ashton and Mila's romance  “Everything is different,” the Black Swan actress noted. “From the fact that you’re so happy when you get six hours of sleep to the idea of being responsible for this incredible, living breathing little human being that you can’t believe is yours,” she gushed.  PHOTOS: Mila's sexy transformation  Kunis also said that she brings baby Wyatt to work with her every day. “I’m super lucky that I could work from home, so to speak,” she said. “My office is downstairs. There’s coming a point in her little life where all my attention can’t always go to her.”  Kutcher, 37, and Kunis welcomed their little one last October. The actress also reflected on the possibility of having more children down the road.  “I mean, not today,” the Jupiter Ascending star revealed. “I’m not pregnant. But yeah, absolutely, for sure!”  Kim K. Reminisces About Birthday Engagement: \"Best Surprise Ever!\"  Sigh, memories. Two years ago, Kim Kardashian wasn’t feeling well but agreed to go out for a birthday dinner with her beau, Kanye West. Instead of going to dinner, he brought her to San Francisco’s AT&T Park for a romantic stadium proposal.  PHOTOS: Kim and Kanye's sweetest moments  On Thursday, Oct. 22, the now-married pregnant reality star, 35, got nostalgic about her special day, posting never-before-seen photos from the surprise on Twitter and to her new website.  “Best surprise ever!” she captioned an intimate pic with her now-hubby.  PHOTOS: Kim's second pregnancy  West, 38, had a live string orchestra play during the proposal, which included the San Francisco Giants’ scoreboard lighting up with the words, “PLEEEASE MARRY MEEE!!!” He then presented her with a massive 15-carat Lorraine Schwartz diamond ring.  YES!!! A photo posted by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Oct 22, 2013 at 8:41am PDT  “Luv this pic pulling into AT&T park,blind folded, w an orchestra playing & had no idea what was about to happen!!!” Kardashian tweeted.

            "text: Duchess of Sussex redirects here. For the title, see Duke of Sussex  American member of the British royal family, and former actress  Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (born Rachel Meghan Markle; August 4, 1981), is an American-born member of the British royal family and a former film and television actress.  Markle was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and is of mixed-race heritage. During her studies at Northwestern University, she began playing small roles in American television series and films. From 2011 to 2017, she played her best-known role, Rachel Zane, on the American legal drama series Suits. As an outspoken feminist, Markle has addressed issues of gender inequality, and her lifestyle website The Tig featured a column profiling influential women. Her humanitarian work in the 2010s saw her represent international charity organizations. She has received recognition for her fashion and style, releasing a line of clothing in 2016.  From 2011 until their divorce in 2013, Markle was married to actor and producer Trevor Engelson. In 2017, she announced her engagement to Prince Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, and moved to London. She consequently retired from acting, closed her social media accounts, and started undertaking public engagements on behalf of the British royal family. Following their wedding on May 19, 2018, Markle became known as the Duchess of Sussex.  Early life and education  Rachel Meghan Markle was born on August 4, 1981, in Los Angeles, California,[1] at West Park Hospital in Canoga Park.[2] As of 2017, her mother, Doria Ragland, a social worker and yoga instructor lives in View Park–Windsor Hills, California.[1][3] Markle has often described a very close friendship with her mother.[4] Her father, Thomas Markle Sr., who lives in Rosarito, Mexico,[5][6] is a retired television director of photography and lighting director, whose profession resulted in his young daughter often visiting the set of Married...with Children.[7][8] Markle's parents divorced when she was six years old.[9][10] She has two older paternal half-siblings, Thomas Markle Jr. and Samantha Markle, from whom she is reportedly estranged.[11]  Describing her heritage in a 2015 essay for Elle, Markle states that her \"dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I'm half black and half white ... While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.\"[12]  Markle grew up in Hollywood.[13] She was educated at private schools, beginning at age two at the Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse.[14][15] At age 11, her successful campaign to get Proctor & Gamble to change a national television commercial she viewed as sexist was profiled by Linda Ellerbee on Nick News.[16] Though she was raised as a Protestant,[17] Markle attended Immaculate Heart High School, an all-girl Catholic private school in Los Angeles.[18] She then attended Northwestern University, where she joined Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and participated in community service and charity projects.[19][20] Markle graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 2003 with a bachelor's degree and a double major in theater and international studies.[21][22] She also served an internship at the American embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina,[22] and studied for a semester in Madrid, Spain.[20]  Acting career  Early in her career, Markle worked as a freelance calligrapher to support herself between acting jobs.[7] Her first on-screen appearance was a small role as a nurse in an episode of the daytime soap opera General Hospital.[23][24] Markle had small guest roles on the television shows Century City (2004), The War at Home (2006), and CSI: NY (2006).[24] She also took on several contract acting and modeling jobs, including a stint as a \"briefcase girl\" on the US game show Deal or No Deal.[7] She appeared in Fox's series Fringe as Junior Agent Amy Jessup in the first two episodes of its second season.[25] Markle had some difficulty getting roles early in her career. In 2015, she wrote: \"Being 'ethnically ambiguous', as I was pegged in the industry, meant I could audition for virtually any role ... Sadly, it didn't matter: I wasn't black enough for the black roles and I wasn't white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn't book a job.\"[26]  In July 2011, Markle joined the cast of the USA Network show Suits, playing Rachel Zane. The character began as a paralegal and eventually became an attorney. She completed work on the seventh season in late 2017.[27] According to a critique in The Irish Times, Markle deftly and \"actively re-positioned\" her character from ingenue to \"the show's moral conscience\" and gave viewers the unique portrayal of a daughter, whose African-American father is in a position to help her career and advance her \"desire to crack both racial and gender glass ceilings\".[28] She appeared in two 2010 films, Get Him to the Greek and Remember Me, and one 2011 film, Horrible Bosses.[29] She also appeared in episodes of Cuts; Love, Inc.; 90210; Knight Rider; Without a Trace; The League; and Castle.[24][30]  From 2014 to 2017, she was founder and editor-in-chief of the lifestyle website The Tig,[31][32] a name she derived from Tignanello red wine.[33] One of The Tig's features was \"Tig Talk\", a column that profiled women including Jessica Alba,[34] Gail Simmons,[35] Ella Woodward,[36] Daphne Oz,[37] Elizabeth Hurley,[38] Lauren Bush,[39] Ivanka Trump,[40] Dianna Agron[41] and Jessica Stam.[42] She closed The Tig in April 2017,[43] and in January 2018, she deleted all of her social media accounts. At the time of its closing, her Instagram account had 1.9 million followers.[44] In a statement issued by Kensington Palace, Markle thanked \"everyone who has followed her social media accounts over the years\".[45][46]  In November 2016, Markle and Canadian clothing company Reitmans released lines of women's fashion workwear and casual-wear.[47] The lines, based on her personal style, and that of her Suits character, described as \"aspirational girl next door\", quickly sold out.[44] In 2010, Markle was paid $187,000 for her role in Remember Me and $171,429 for her role in the short film The Candidate.[48] For her role on Suits, Fortune magazine estimated that Markle was paid $50,000 per episode, amounting to an annual salary of about $450,000.[49] In addition, it was estimated that as a lifestyle blogger she earned about $80,000 annually from endorsements and sponsorships.[48] In 2017, her total net worth was estimated at $5 million.[48] In 2018, she was among the nominees for the 2018 Teen Choice Awards in the category Choice Style Icon.[50]  Personal life  Markle began a relationship with actor and producer Trevor Engelson in 2004.[51][52] They married in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, on September 10, 2011,[53] and separated through a no-fault divorce in August 2013,[54] citing irreconcilable differences.[55]  Markle was in a relationship with celebrity chef and restaurateur Cory Vitiello for almost two years.[56] They lived together in their residence in Toronto.[57] Their relationship ended in May 2016.[56]  Markle and Prince Harry attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  In June 2016, Markle began a relationship with Prince Harry,[58][59] who was then fifth in line to the British throne.[60] Markle and Prince Harry met on a blind date set up by a mutual friend.[61] The press began to report on the relationship in October 2016.[62] On November 8, 2016, the British royal family's communications secretary released an official statement that addressed a \"wave of abuse and harassment\" directed toward Markle.[63] The statement described sexism, racism and defamatory stories directed at her.[64][65][66] During a September 2017 interview with Vanity Fair, Markle spoke in public for the first time about her love for Prince Harry.[67] Later that month, they made their first public appearance together at an official royal engagement at the Invictus Games in Toronto.[68][69]  While working on Suits, Markle lived in a rented house in the Seaton Village neighborhood of Toronto, Canada, where the show is filmed.[70] She lived in Canada for nine months each year, making a few close friends.[44] She moved out in late November 2017 after work on the seventh season had been completed.[71]  Markle has two rescue dogs, a labrador-shepherd named Bogart and a beagle named Guy, whom she adopted in 2012 and 2015 respectively.[72][73]  Royal marriage  Markle's engagement to Prince Harry was announced on November 27, 2017.[58][74] By then, she had met Queen Elizabeth II, Harry's paternal grandmother, several times.[75] The engagement announcement prompted generally positive comment about the possible social significance of a mixed-race member of the royal family.[76] The ring Harry gave Markle consists of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from the jewellery collection of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.[77] Following the engagement, Markle announced she would retire from acting,[78][79] and began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[80]  In preparation for the wedding, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, baptised Markle and confirmed her into the Church of England on March 6, 2018.[81] The private ceremony, performed with water from the River Jordan, took place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace.[81] The marriage ceremony was held on May 19, 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[82] The Duke and Duchess live at Nottingham Cottage in London, in the grounds of Kensington Palace.[83]  Public life  Markle greeting the public in Belfast, March 2018  Markle accompanied Harry for the first time during an official public appearance after their engagement at a walkabout in Nottingham on December 1, 2017,[84][85] in connection with World AIDS Day.[86] The Queen invited them to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at her Sandringham estate.[87] In early 2018, Markle accompanied Harry on his engagements in Brixton,[86] Cardiff,[88] Goldsmiths' Hall,[89] and Edinburgh.[90] On February 28, 2018, Markle attended an official engagement at the first annual forum of The Royal Foundation, \"Making a Difference Together\" with the prince.[91] She became the fourth patron, alongside Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, after her marriage into the royal family.[92] Markle and Harry marked International Women's Day by attending an event in Birmingham hosted by the Stemettes.[93] Along with the Queen and other members of the royal family, she attended the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on March 12, 2018.[94] The couple made their first visit to Northern Ireland on March 23, 2018.[95] Markle carried out a total of 26 public engagements prior to the wedding.[96]  The Duchess's first official engagement after the wedding came on May 22 when she and her husband attended Prince Charles' 70th birthday garden party to celebrate his charity work.[97] Her first trip abroad at the request of the British government was to Dublin, Ireland, in July 2018.[98][99] According to a review in The Irish Times, her visit became a unique national obsession.[100] In June 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the Duke and Duchess would tour Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand around the time of the Invictus Games which will be held in Sydney in October 2018.[101][102]  Fashion and style  Markle cited Emmanuelle Alt as her style inspiration in 2017.[103][104] In an interview with Glamour, the Duchess said that she favored \"that French way of styling, where if your outfit is pulled together, then something's got to be dishevelled—your hair, your make-up\".[103] In her youth, Markle's \"sensibility had always been relaxed California girl style\" consisting of jeans, cut-offs and flip-flops.[104] She usually prefers \"streamlined dresses\" with \"neutral colors\" and boat-neck necklines,[105][106] and likes \"monochromatic and tonal dressing\".[104] She has worn outfits and ensembles by many fashion designers.[103] The media takes note of the brands she uses.[103]  In December 2017, Markle caused a surge in interest in Scottish retailer Strathberry after carrying one of their handbags to a public event shortly after her engagement.[107][108] This was reported as an indication that her fashion choices would produce her own version of the Kate effect.[107][109] It has been speculated that Markle's effect would be greater, as she has a strong appeal in America.[109] After Markle and Prince Harry's first appearance as a couple, brands Mackage, Birks, R&R Jewelers, Crown Jewelers and Everlane noted an upswing in their website hits and sales.[110][111][108]  Charity work  Markle was a counselor for international charity One Young World. She attended its 2014 and 2016 summits.[112] At the 2014 summit in Dublin, she spoke on the topics of gender equality and modern-day slavery.[113] Also in 2014, she traveled to Afghanistan and Spain as part of the United Service Organizations Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Holiday Tour.[114][115][116]  In 2016, Markle became a global ambassador for World Vision Canada, traveling to Rwanda for the Clean Water Campaign, the agency's campaign to provide safe, clean drinking water,[117][118][26] and she traveled to India to raise awareness of issues concerning women.[119] Upon returning from India, she penned an op-ed for Time magazine concerning stigmatization of women in regard to menstrual health.[120] She has also worked with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women as an Advocate.[117][121] The Duchess is a vocal feminist and likely to use her role as a member of the royal family to continue supporting women's rights and social justice.[122]  In 2018, Time magazine included Markle on its list 100 Most Influential People in the World.[123][124] She was also chosen as one of the most influential women in the United Kingdom by Vogue magazine.[125]  Titles, styles, and arms  Titles and styles  Royal monogram  Upon her marriage to Prince Harry, Meghan Markle became a princess of the United Kingdom entitled to the style of Royal Highness, as well as Duchess of Sussex, Countess of Dumbarton and Baroness Kilkeel.[126][127] She is styled as \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex\",[128] and she is the first person to hold that title.[129]  Arms  Ancestry  On her mother's side, the Duchess of Sussex is descended from African Americans enslaved in Georgia,[132] and on her father's side from German,[133] English,[134] and Irish settlers.[135] One of her possible forefathers, Heinrich Martin Merckel, emigrated to the United States from Lampertsloch, an historically German-speaking town in Alsace, and later changed the spelling of his name to Markle.[133] Among her father's distant ancestors are Captain Christopher Hussey, King Robert I of Scotland, Sir Philip Wentworth, and Edward III of England.[136][137]  Filmography  Television  Film  References\n",

            "text: In February I saw a photo of Meghan Markle and the Duchess of Cambridge sitting next to each other at the Royal Foundation Forum, wearing colour coordinated dresses (lavender for Kate, deep purple-blue for Meghan). It wasn’t their dresses I minded, it was how they sat – legs crossed neatly at the ankle, knees pressed firmly together. It was that dulce et decorum pose passed down to generations of girls and young women expected to demonstrate their good breeding on social occasions – expected to show they are “ladies”. Both Kate and Meghan had folded their hands in their laps, the arms forming a gentle circle, the hands quietly clasped, as if ready to shelter a child or calm a kingdom’s cares. But it was the legs that haunted me – in part because I’d been taught that same bit of etiquette when I was a young black midwestern girl in the 1950s and early 60s, a child of the manners- and achievement-conscious black bourgeoisie, which in those days we called the Negro elite.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Meghan Markle and the Duchess of Cambridge at the Royal Foundation Forum. Photograph: Chris Jackson/AFP/Getty Images  In fact, things turned out better than I’d feared. In a subsequent photo Kate crossed her legs at the knee. And when both women were asked in the video about the causes they planned to take up, Meghan spoke out. The words “MeToo” and “Time’sUp” flowed from her lips. So did the words “I fundamentally disagree”, as in: “What’s interesting is … when speaking about girls’ and women’s empowerment you’ll often hear people say: ‘Well, you’re helping women find their voices,’ and I fundamentally disagree with that. Women don’t need to find a voice, they have a voice, and they need to feel empowered to use it, and people need to be encouraged to listen.”  Rachel Meghan Markle, for those who have chosen or somehow managed to miss the ceaseless chronicling of her life thus far, is the only daughter of Thomas Markle (white), an Emmy award-winning cinematographer and lighting designer, and Doria Ragland (black), a social worker and yoga instructor who focuses on community mental health. This union of white Hollywood and black social-spiritual activism made her the offspring of a modern and ever more varied biracial bourgeoisie.  The family settled in Woodland Hills, a prosperous Los Angeles neighbourhood. Prosperous and largely white: Meghan’s mother was regularly mistaken for her nanny there. This must have happened in the 80s and early 90s when she was a young girl; it still happens in the US to every black woman I know who has a mixed-race child.  Meghan’s parents divorced when she was six, and she lived with her mother after that, although she saw her father regularly. There are two half-siblings from his previous marriage, both quite a bit older. Relations with them, at least since the courtship and engagement, have been strained.  Timeline Prince Harry's relationship with Meghan Markle Show Hide  The pair meet in London through friends and begin a relationship. News breaks that the prince and Markle are dating. Kensington Palace confirms in an unprecedented statement that they are dating. The prince attacks the media over its “abuse and harassment” of his girlfriend.  Markle is spotted in London amid unconfirmed reports she is enjoying her first stay at Kensington Palace since the relationship was made public. Markle reportedly meets the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte for the first time in London.  The engagement looks set when Markle graces the cover of US magazine Vanity Fair and speaks openly about Harry for the first time, revealing: “We’re two people who are really happy and in love.” Markle makes her first appearance at an official engagement attended by the prince when she attends the Invictus Games opening ceremony in Toronto, Canada – although the pair sit about 18 seats apart. It emerges that the prince has taken Markle to meet his grandmother, the Queen, whose permission they need to marry. They met over afternoon tea at Buckingham Palace. The prince’s aides are reported to have been told to start planning for a royal wedding, with senior members of the royal family asked to look at their diaries to shortlist a series of suitable weekends in 2018. Markle is spotted in London, prompting speculation she is preparing for an engagement announcement. Clarence House announces the engagement, and the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh say they are “delighted for the couple and wish them every happiness”.  The couple marry before a celebrity-studded congregation at St George's Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle.    Markle majored in international relations and theatre at Northwestern University, Illinois. Besides becoming an actor, she became a feminist who worked for UN Women as an advocate for political participation and leadership. Yes, she has been praised and criticised as “outspoken”, but her style never risks being “aggressive” or “combative”, or any of the other words thrown at women who are deemed insufficiently graceful when they disagree with men. Even when she makes staunch political statements, her manner astutely – sometimes cloyingly – balances the forthright and the pleasing. She’s learned to use political maxims and assertions very effectively. As in: “It’s time to focus less on glass slippers and more on glass ceilings.” With the word “fairytale” now a ubiquitous tag line for the royal romance, this should be a useful daily mantra.  The Cinderella story refuses to dwindle into a period piece; in the last 20 years alone there have been six film remakes with white, black and Latina leads. But Markle has not been plucked from poverty or – like the heroines of such romcom adaptations as Pretty Woman and Maid in Manhattan – from the low-status toil and trouble of working-class life. Her net worth as an actor has been estimated at around $5m. An actor’s fortunes can fluctuate, especially when that actor is a woman. But so can the fortunes of a wife. If the royal marriage were to end in divorce, Markle would not have to depend on the Windsor millions nor, like many once-upon-a-time celebrities, design a skincare or jewellery line for QVC.  Any 'commoner' who marries into any royal family ​is seen as marrying up. But Harry is marrying up too, by marrying out  Love that results in the bride’s near magical social ascent is the key element in Cinderella tales. But is Markle automatically marrying up by marrying a prince? In the old school way, yes: any “commoner” who marries into any royal family is seen as marrying up. But Harry is marrying up too. He’s marrying up by marrying out – out of long-entwined bloodlines, out of entrenched rituals and hierarchies, out of a lineage as constricted as it is privileged. We always ascribe social ambitions to commoners, but aristocrats have their own longings for a world elsewhere. Harry is marrying into all the possibilities of postmodernity. It’s a world where – as Zora Neale Hurston said of black folktales and music – hierarchies, styles, sites of social and cultural change are being made and forgotten every day.  In this world-elsewhere that is here and now, Markle’s identities as a progressive biracial and black feminist are impeccable. When speaking of her role on TV series Suits, as the biracial lawyer with a black father, she said: “Some households may never have had a black person in their house as a guest, or someone biracial. Well, now there are a lot of us on your TV and in your home with you.” And now there are even a few of us in the castles you see on TV.  How would a global marketer for the royal family describe their marriage? Charles is not going to help the royal brand become fresh and contemporary. William and Kate are contemporary royals – unpretentious, decent and likable. But they do not suggest risk or daring. Today the House of Windsor is like a venerable and all too predictable fashion house. Its cultural currency depends on history packaged as costume drama: The Queen, The Crown, The King’s Speech, Darkest Hour. To flourish it must attract new designers, new ideas and new muses. And let me end my fashion analogy by noting that in March this year, Virgil Abloh, a Ghanaian American designer, was named artistic director of menswear for Louis Vuitton, a fashion house founded in 1854 when Queen Victoria was on the throne and the royal family had yet to be rebranded as the House of Windsor.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Prince and Markle pictured at Kensington Palace in November 2017, just after their engagement was announced. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters  ¶  Perhaps a better genre through which to read the complexities of the Meghan-Harry narrative is the romantic comedy. In the best romcoms, attraction is ignited by tension and difference. Thwarted too. The characters have to learn something from each other and something about themselves; negotiate across troublesome boundaries (gender and class privilege, temperament), and learn to take emotional risks.  For this union, Harry has had to renounce his protected status as a vivaciously shallow party boy whose transgressions took the form of booze-fuelled pranks, such as showing up at a friend’s birthday party in a Nazi desert uniform with a swastika armband (the party’s theme was “colonial and native”), or hosting a game of strip poker in a Las Vegas hotel room. Reformation followed in three stages, each appealing to a different constituency. He served in Afghanistan. He recently confessed to emotional and mental health problems that began soon after his mother’s death: a shutdown of feelings, bouts of rage and anxiety followed by psychological counselling.  Finally, there came his involvement with Markle. A professional woman, an educated woman, a 36-year-old divorced American woman, a woman of colour and a feminist whose presence in his life would soon require that he forcefully denounce racism and sexism in the British press (and, I trust, among his more un-woke friends and relations). “I’ve never wanted to be a lady who lunches – I’ve always wanted to be a woman who works,” Markle once said. In show business she worked her way up. She didn’t become a Hollywood superstar; she did become a skilled, well-paid lead in a highly rated TV series. She had a social conscience, which she acted on. And now, she is more famous and more influential than she was ever likely to be on her own. It remains the way of the world. Does Amal Clooney have more resources as a human rights lawyer and philanthropist now that she is married to George Clooney? No doubt.  Once a woman enters a royal family, every aspect and function of her body becomes a site of proprietary fantasy  Whatever we think of her new job requirements, Markle will remain a working woman with a lifetime of public performances ahead. Every word, every gesture, every detail of dress will be scrutinised and read for subtext. The touches of white on her navy J Crew coat? A tribute to the British suffragettes. Bare legs instead of tights for the engagement photos? A subtle flouting of royal dress proscriptions.  Once a woman enters a royal family, every aspect and function of her body becomes a site of proprietary fantasy. The female body as a nation’s procreative destiny: the only real change through the centuries is that fantasy has replaced realpolitik. For Diana Spencer, that meant her uncle certifying her virgin status in a tabloid newspaper interview shortly after her engagement to Charles. As if his niece’s body parts were a bride price to be flaunted, eliciting leers and cheers.  For Markle, it means media warnings that she is 36 years old and shouldn’t wait much longer. “Meghan, Oh Baby! Meghan and Harry Planning a Honeymoon Knock-Up” went one headline. Her former husband, producer Trevor Engelson, is also conjuring imaginary children. He has announced plans for a Fox comedy: “Divorce is hard,” goes its pitch. “Sharing custody is harder when an ex-wife marries a British prince. Sharing custody with the British royal family in the unforgiving spotlight of London’s tabloid media is next level.”  ¶  “Meghan Markle Looks Gorgeous With Naturally Curly Hair in Childhood.” The published photo was charming, as is the video of her at 11, with a curly frizzy ponytail, chastising the ad industry for its sexism. Many of us used to ask if we’d ever see Michelle Obama in an updated version of the afro she wore in her pre-public figure days. Many of us used to answer that the furore it would cause – the afro as proof of the first lady’s secret allegiance to white-hating black militants – probably wasn’t worth the gesture. And since a small dust-up followed Meghan’s recent appearance in a bun with wavy tendrils around her face, it’s hard alas to imagine how anything, including the claim of biographer Andrew Morton that she is a direct descendant of Robert the Bruce, would atone for a full display of those racially marked curly/wavy/frizzy locks.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Markle at her aunt’s wedding. Photograph: Mail on Sunday/Solo Syndication  But if she never wears her version of a natural, she has already done race history a real service. She has helped scuttle false, foolish constructs of “the mulatto” that were developed a few centuries ago to counter the very real threat that mixed-race people posed to the constructs of white supremacy. To serve popular culture, the female mulatto became a source of social and erotic intrigue, a figure who needed strict narrative policing. Stories, novels, plays and early films gave her two options.  She could be a scheming seductress (see Lydia Brown in DW Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation, the mistress of a gullible white abolitionist played by a panting and grimacing white actress). Or she could be tragic (as in Dion Boucicault’s The Octoroon of 1859, and Charles Chesnutt’s The House Behind the Cedars of 1900), a beautiful, seemingly white woman of faultlessly refined bearing, doomed by the taint of black ancestry. The tragic version attracts the love of a well-born young white man who does not know her secret. She tries – she hopes, she longs – to pass for white, and the ruse works for a time. But, when the innocent gentleman proposes marriage, the plot dictates that her shame be revealed and she must die, by her own hand or from a fatal disease.  Decades of scholarship and memoir have corrected and complicated this narrative, of course. Still it lingers and titillates, a handy tool for condescension, suspicion and breezy sneers. A key theme in these stories is the heroine’s terror that, if she marries her white hero, she might bear a child whose skin colour would reveal the dreaded racial truth. I imagine there’s plenty of spiteful, behind-the-scenes chatter about whether this “touch of the tarbrush” will taint Meghan and Harry’s offspring. Perhaps the “blackamoor” brooch that Princess Michael of Kent was photographed wearing on her way to a royal event with Harry and Meghan was meant to signify such a dread: Meghan as the black ewe tupped by a white ram, who will produce a shamefully black offspring.  And surely the Daily Mail was gesturing towards this when it ran a story about the ostensibly tawdry origins of Markle and her mother, titled: “Harry’s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton: Gang-scarred home of her mother revealed – so will he be dropping by for tea?” Doria Ragland was cast as “a dreadlocked African American lady from the wrong side of the tracks”. One whose career as a yoga instructor and social worker suddenly made her the equivalent of the mulatta’s disreputable mother, who gathers roots and practises hoodoo.  Early rumours had it that Ragland would walk her daughter down the aisle (with her usual dreads, I hoped). Now it’s reported that Markle’s father will, or that they will share the duty. I vote for Ragland alone. Still, to watch a divorced, interracial couple walk the royal red carpet has its own rewards when, once upon a time just 51 years ago, US law forbade their marriage.  Like any black and biracial woman, she has had a lifetime of learning to both confront and navigate codes  In 2015 Markle wrote an essay for Elle in which she quite eloquently established that she is both biracial and black. She started with the blunt racial slurs of her childhood, which turned, as she grew, into the patronising queries and assumptions favoured by adults who think themselves liberal. A perfect example was the teacher who told her to fill in “white” on a census because “that’s how you look, Meghan”. Intended as a compliment, no doubt. In the essay, she also discussed the institutional racism exposed by the police shootings in Ferguson and Baltimore. She recalled the flurry of racist tweets set off when Wendell Pierce was cast as her African American father on Suits: “Ew, she’s black? I used to think she was hot.” Then, having described both her struggles with, and her pride in, being biracial, she ended the essay with a tribute to her black ancestry.  “You create the identity you want for yourself, just as my ancestors did when they were given their freedom. Because in 1865 (which is so shatteringly recent), when slavery was abolished in the United States, former slaves had to choose a name. A surname, to be exact. Perhaps the closest thing to connecting me to my ever-complex family tree, my longing to know where I come from, and the commonality that links me to my bloodline, is the choice that my great-great-great grandfather made to start anew. He chose the last name Wisdom. He drew his own box.” Excellently done, I thought. She’s refusing to let white readers white out her black identity.  When it comes to issues of race, gender, sexuality and class, how much can Meghan Markle say and do? How much does she want to say and do? We simply don’t know yet. Like any black and biracial woman, she has had a lifetime of learning to both confront and dextrously navigate codes that range from the puzzling to the vehemently punitive. Like every actress she’s had to confront misogyny. But she has options that previous generations did not.  The speech she gave at the 2015 UN women’s conference began in rousing, declamatory mode: “I am proud to be a woman and a feminist”; moved to personal narrative (this part grounded in the story of how she organised her campaign against that sexist television ad at age 11); then built up to inspirational political exhortation. “It is said that girls with dreams become women with vision. May we empower each other to carry out this vision, because it isn’t enough to simply talk about equality, one must believe in it, and it isn’t enough to believe in it, one must work for it.” May the work recommence once the £32m wedding is done.  • On Michael Jackson by Margo Jefferson is published by Granta.\n",

            "text: Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge welcomed the newest addition to the Royal Family on Monday. Now, Will and Kate Middleton have announced what the baby boy’s name is.  The royal baby name is Louis Arthur Charles, Kensington Palace announced on Twitter Friday. His royal title will be His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge.  While the royal baby name odds on Louis were 33/1 could make it appear to be a surprising choice, the names Louis, Arthur and Charles have significance within the royal family. Louis was the name of Prince Phillip’s grandfather, Prince Louis Alexander of Battenberg, as well as Prince Charles’ great-uncle Earl Louis Mountbatten, who was assassinated by the IRA in 1979. Louis is also a middle name for both Prince William and Prince George.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their newborn son. Kirsty O'Connor - PA Images—PA Images via Getty Images  As for Prince Louis’ middle names, Arthur was a middle name of Queen Elizabeth’s late father King George VI and is a middle name to both William and Prince Charles. Arthur of course also brings to mind King Arthur (though experts say there’s no evidence of any actual historical king behind the famous Arthurian legends).  Prince Louis shares his third name, Charles, with his grandfather, Prince Charles.  Louis Arthur Charles is the third child for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who welcomed a son, Prince George, in 2013 and a daughter, Princess Charlotte, in 2015.  Ahead of Louis Arthur Charles’s birth, the couple announced via the official Kensington Palace Twitter account that Middleton was expecting in September 2017, but opted not to reveal the baby’s gender (something they had done with their previous two children) ahead of the birth.  The baby’s birth is just one of a series of exciting life events for the royal family this spring, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be getting married next month on May 19th.\n",

            "text: Getty  Meghan has been looking a bit peaky at the last few events.  ‘She’s usually so full of energy and very lively – but she definitely seems tired and withdrawn at the moment,’ says a source. ‘Of course, all the baby whispers would explain why she’s not herself and seems so pale.’  The exciting development comes just weeks after Meghan described being married as ‘wonderful’, before adding Harry is ‘the best husband ever’.  The news was first shared with the Queen the same day, just before Meghan boarded the train to Cheshire.  ‘It gave the Queen and Meghan a lot to talk about during their journey on the Royal Train together and there was lots of baby talk,’ reveals a source.  According to the insider, Harry has always been the Queen’s favourite and she’s taken a definite liking to Meghan – she sees a lot of herself in Meghan’s strength and tenacity.  Related: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry 'actively trying' to start a family  Related: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry reportedly 'having twins'  And to hear that they’re to be parents is exciting for Her Majesty.  ‘We haven’t seen the Queen that happy and that excited in a long time – it was wonderful to see,’ the insider revealed.  The source went on to say the mood has really continued throughout the palace since they returned. And no-one could be happier.  ‘Meghan’s still in the early stages of her pregnancy, but the palace is already working on announcements. This is the news the world has been waiting for.’  The royal couple, who are set to carry out a tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga in October, are making sure to cram in as many overseas tours as they can before Meghan is too big to travel.  ‘Harry and Meghan wanted to get a few visits in so that she could get to know the Commonwealth countries and start making a contribution to the royal family,’ revealed a source. ‘But the Queen understands that their main priority is to start a family.’  Meanwhile, royal fans in the UK have been madly placing bets on Meghan and Harry announcing their pregnancy in 2018, with Ladbrokes giving the odds a 4/6 chance.  Last month a friend close to the couple also told The Mirror: ‘They’re desperate to have a family as soon as possible’.  So keen are Harry and Meghan to have children, sources also claimed that the couple actually started trying for a baby before they got married.  Getty  Given the fact that Meghan is 36 and her biological clock is ticking, the couple didn’t want to wait to start a family.  ‘They actually stopped using protection over two months ago, although they abstained from sex in the weeks leading up to the wedding,’ a source told Hollywood Life.  And Harry previously talked about wanting kids before he even met Meghan. ‘I’ve longed for kids since I was very, very young,’ he said back in 2012.  ‘I’m waiting to find the right person. Someone who is willing to take on the job.’  In their sit-down interview with the BBC Harry expressed his desire to have children sooner rather than later: ‘We will start a family in the near future,’ he said.  Thankfully, according to royal expert Katie Nicholl, his wife is the perfect mother-to-be.  ‘Meghan is very doting with children. She is very maternal and she was thrilled to meet George and Charlotte. I think one of the lovely things that I discovered [while writing] the book was it was actually a moment involving children when Meghan really fell for Prince Harry,’ she said.

            "text: Meghan Markle may now be officially known as the Duchess of Sussex, but to her friends, she’s still just “Meg.”  Makeup artist Daniel Martin — the creative consultant for Honest Beauty, Dior Beauty brand ambassador and a longtime friend of Meghan’s who helped her achieve the perfect beauty look for her wedding day — tells PEOPLE that even he was confused as to what to call her after she was married to Prince Harry.  “I asked her that. ‘Do I bow to you? I don’t want to disrespect you, but I’ve known for almost ten years. What’s up?'” he recalls. “She started laughing and she said, ‘I’m always going to be Meg.

But Meg is always going to be Meg, that’s how it is!”  Watch our full special, Meghan and Harry – a Fairy-Tale Wedding, on PeopleTV, now available on PeopleTV.com and on your favorite streaming device.  Martin says there were just five people around while prepping Meghan for her walk down the aisle: the bride, himself, hair stylist Serge Normant, dress designer Clare Waight Keller and Meghan’s mom Doria Ragland, who Martin said was “in good spirits.” The atmosphere was very relaxed, partly thanks to Meghan playing “1950s, chilled music” via Spotify.  “She didn’t seem nervous. She was very cool, she was regular Meghan,” the makeup artist shares. “I think we were nervous, but we didn’t want to make her nervous so it was very chilled. Of course, brides have nerves, but if we didn’t put so much expectation on it, it wouldn’t have made her nervous. It was very even, very easy.”  Martin added that the bride stayed off her phone as they caught up by talking about mutual friends.  Despite all their beauty work, putting on the wedding dress really made the moment feel real.  “It was all so easy. It didn’t hit us that she was getting married until she got the dress on,” Martin said.  He added, “It was so beautiful and so architectural, and when she put it on it was like a glove. It was so easy. The spectacle of the veil and the crown and it was, ‘Oh my goodness, this is really happening.’ ”  RELATED VIDEO: Harry and Meghan’s Love Story  That feeling intensified when they arrived at Windsor Castle.  “Nothing really hit any of us until we got there and we saw the people and the magnitude of everything,” he said. “The last thing we said to each other was, ‘We’ll see you on the other side.’ ”  Meghan Markle Brian Lawless - WPA Pool/Getty  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Mark R.

It was almost like she looked at me and said, ‘What did you think? How’d it go?’ And I lost it.”  He continued, “It was so moving and so perfect and the day couldn’t have been better.”\n",

            "text: The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.

            "text: Report claiming Queen Elizabeth gave Michelle Obama a \"brutal beatdown\" or that Barack Obama \"stalked\" Prince Harry on Twitter is fake news.  A fabricated story that Michelle Obama tried to “sneak a spot” on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding guest list is untrue. A blog called Just News USA claimed that Queen Elizabeth “delivered a brutal beatdown” to Michelle for trying to wormhole her way to being one of the exclusive guests at the royal wedding, which is to be held over Memorial Day weekend in 2018.  The website also alleged that Barack Obama “practically stalked” Prince Harry on Twitter, sending a message of congratulations to him “within seconds of the [engagement] news coming out,” which “perhaps had an undertone of letting the royals know that he and Michelle were available that day to attend.” It went on to claim that the former president posted a number of “desperate” tweets to Prince Harry in an effort to score a place on the guest list. The article added that the queen “royally snubbed” Barack and Michelle Obama’s attempts to attend Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding.  Gossip Cop reports that the only shred of truth to the the website’s story is that Barack’s congratulatory message to Prince Harry was soon after the wedding announcement. He wished the prince and Meghan Markle “a lifetime of joy and happiness” on Twitter. The message was in no way a massive hint to the royals that he and Michelle were “available” to attend their wedding ceremony. Just that alone is false because Harry and Meghan’s wedding date hadn’t yet been revealed until two days after their announcement.  The claims made by Just News USA that Michelle Obama tried to “sneak a spot” on the wedding guest list is largely viewed as ludicrous, especially since no other details are offered regarding Queen Elizabeth’s “beatdown” of her.  Story About Queen Elizabeth Giving Michelle Obama “Beatdown” Over Prince Harry Wedding Invite Is Made-Up https://t.co/X3FQsNnLc9 — Gossip Cop (@GossipCop) December 4, 2017  As Gossip Cop reports, if the Obamas get invited to the royal wedding, it’ll be for other reasons — such as being good friends with Prince Harry. It won’t come as a result of desperate pleas on social media. The article is characterized as “fake news” by the site that often debunks rumors and other made up stories about celebrities. The site will probably be correcting a number of inaccurate articles between now and when the royal wedding is held next year. All of the commotion about who’s going to be included on the ultra exclusive guest list will be talked about for months to come.  It’s unknown if Barack and Michelle Obama will attend Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding, but speculations suggest they’ll most likely be on the guest list.

            "text: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had one of the most high-profile weddings of the decade — but their relationship started off top-secret.  Here's a look at their love story from the first blind date to the aisle of Windsor Castle:  How They Met  Harry and Markle first made each other's acquaintance on a blind date in early July, 2016. \"We were introduced actually by a mutual friend,\" Harry revealed during the couple's first sit-down interview with the BBC following their engagement announcement. (E! News claims Harry's friend Violet von Westenholz is the one who introduced them, but others have speculated it was fashion designer Mischa Nonoo.)

Despite Prince Harry's global fame, Markle says she didn't have a lot of preconceived notions about who he was before they met. \"Because I’m from the States, you don’t grow up with the same understanding of the royal family,\" she explained during the BBC interview. \"I didn’t know much about him, so the only thing that I had asked [our mutual friend] when she said that she wanted to set us up, was, 'Well is he nice?' Cause if he wasn't kind, it just didn’t seem like it would make sense.\"  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle during the televised interview following the announcement of their engagement. YouTube  The two hit it off immediately. \"We met for a drink,\" said Markle, \"and then I think very quickly into that we said, 'Well what are we doing tomorrow? We should meet again.'\"  At the photo call in the Kensington Palace gardens following their engagement announcement, Harry was asked when he knew Markle was the one. He quickly replied, \"the very first time we met.\"  Things moved quickly from there. The couple went on a second date and Prince Harry then invited Markle to accompany him on a trip to Africa just three or four weeks later. \"I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana and we camped out with each other under the stars,\" he said, describing the whirlwind romance. \"Then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure that we had a chance to get to know each other.\"    The News Gets Out  After four months of quiet dating, the news finally leaked on October 31, 2016 that Prince Harry was dating an American actress. A source told the Sunday Express that Harry is “happier than he’s been for many years” and is \"besotted\" with the Markle. On the same day, Markle posted a sweet photo on her Instagram of two bananas spooning, possibly hinting at the new love in her life.

In November 2016, the Vancouver Sun published an interview with Markle promoting her collection for retailer Reitmans. In the interview, she discussed her collaboration with Reitmans, her charity work with World Vision, and her plans for the holidays. Though she avoided any mention of Harry, she happily said, “So, my cup runneth over and I’m the luckiest girl in the world!”  Around the same time, People reported that Harry had already introduced the actress to his father, Prince Charles.  Harry Makes a Public Statement in Defense of His Girlfriend  Harry confirmed his relationship with Markle in a formal statement November 8, 2016. In the statement, Harry also pleads the press and trolls on social media to stop the “wave of abuse and harassment\" that had been directed at his girlfriend.  Getty Images  According to Harry, he has been involved with “nightly legal battles” to stop the media from publishing defamatory stories about Markle and their relationship.  Prince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle’s safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her. It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm. He knows commentators will say this is ‘the price she has to pay’ and that ‘this is all part of the game’. He strongly disagrees. This is not a game - it is her life and his.  During the BBC interview, Harry revealed that both he and Markle were taken aback by the media scrutiny. \"I think both of us were totally surprised by the reaction.\"  Many assumed that Markle would be prepared for the onslaught of attention because she had been in the public eye as an actress, but little could have prepared her for what was to come. \"There was a misconception that because I have worked in the entertainment industry that this would be something I would be familiar with,\" she said. \"But I've never been part of tabloid culture. I've never been in pop culture to that degree and and lived a relatively quiet life.\"  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Prince Harry with school children in Antigua in November, 2016. Getty Images  Her answer, she told the BBC, was to tune out the noise. \"I think we were just hit so hard at the beginning with a lot of mistruths that I made the choice to not read anything, positive or negative. It just didn't make sense and instead we focused all of our energies just on nurturing our relationship.\"    On November 18, she shared a Mahatma Gandhi quote on her Instagram, which many people interpreted as a response to Harry's statement on their relationship.  Even Prince William Is Forced to Weigh In  On November 27, 2016, Prince William released a statement to clear up rumors that he was unhappy with his brother's decision to open up about his relationship. A portion of the statement reads, “The Duke of Cambridge absolutely understands the situation concerning privacy and supports the need for Prince Harry to support those closest to him.\"  Harry and Meghan Continue to Grow Closer  In early December 2016, Markle is photographed in Toronto wearing a gold necklace featuring the letters “M” and “H.” Later that month, she and Harry are spotted together picking out a 6-foot Christmas tree, and in London's West End holding hands on their way to see the Tony award-winning show The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime. According to The Sun, the couple walk through the Soho area while admiring the Christmas lights throughout Piccadilly Circus.

This is the first time that the often incognito couple vacation together and according to Us Weekly, Harry planned the romantic getaway so that the two could to catch the Northern Lights.

Markle is Harry's plus one to the wedding as the prince serves as one of the ceremony's 14 ushers. A source later revealed to People, that the two were incredibly \"joyful\" during the wedding festivities, and seemed very much in love.  In April, Harry flew from England to spend Easter weekend with Markle in Toronto. Photos are released by E! Online and reveal the young prince wearing a baseball cap and toting a large duffle bag while entering Markle’s building.  Meghan's Life Begins to Change  In April, Markle announced that she would shut down her lifestyle website, The Tig, which she had founded three years earlier. In a statement shared on both the Tig website and her Instagram, Markle said:  What began as a passion project (my little engine that could) evolved into an amazing community of inspiration, support, fun and frivolity. You’ve made my days brighter and filled this experience with so much joy. Keep finding those Tig moments of discovery, keep laughing and taking risks, and keep being the change you wish to see in the world.\"  Though it is rumored that Markle shut down her passion project as a sacrifice to her royal relationship, a source told People that the real reason was her busy schedule, balancing charity work with shooting Suits.    The Couple Steps Out  Markle and Harry made their first public appearance as a couple (and shared a kiss) at the annual Audi Polo Challenge in Ascot, England. As Harry participated in the games, Markle, wearing a chic navy dress and white blazer, cheered on her prince from the sidelines.

            "text: Princess Eugenie’s engagement announcement caused a right royal stir on Monday — and so did her unusual ring.  The pink padparadsha sapphire, surrounded by diamonds, is similar in style to the ruby engagement ring her dad, Prince Andrew, gave to Sarah Ferguson when he proposed in 1986.  Eugenie, 27, announced she would wed James Brooksbank this autumn in the Windsor venue that will see Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tie the knot in May.  But that doesn’t mean she’ll be overshadowed by the wedding of the year — and the price of her sparkler proves it.  The gem expert from British TV show “Posh Pawn” has estimated the value of Eugenie’s ring at $140,000 — double the estimated value of Markle’s.  The three-diamond ring that Prince Harry’s fiancee wears is estimated to be worth around $70,000.  Gemologist Deborah Papas, from Prestige Pawnbrokers, told the Sun Online: “Like her mother, the Duchess of York and indeed Princess Diana, Eugenie’s ring has a center oval precious gemstone and this one certainly has not disappointed.  “It is a padparadscha sapphire surrounded by 10 brilliant cut diamonds and two pear cut diamonds to give an edge to the standard classic cluster.  “Padparadscha is the name given to the corundum gem that bears a mixture of red and yellow, a sort of cross between a ruby and yellow sapphire.  “This beautiful gem is considered amongst the rarest and most valuable of all the corundum varieties.  “With its carefully faceted cut and the set off with the whitest of white diamonds, this ring could easily be worth over £100,000 [$140,000].  “Padparadscha sapphires are amongst the rarest and most valuable depending on quality and a little bit of difference in quality can mean a big difference in price.”  Papas admits that estimating such a valuable gem is difficult without full access but adds: “We estimate it to be in excess of £100,000 [$140,000].”  The princess has dated the 31-year-old party organizer for six years, and her parents, the Duke and Duchess of York, said they were delighted with the news.  Royal insider Dickie Arbiter revealed that the princess’s marriage to the 31-year-old would be even more star-studded than Markle’s — and the role that Sarah Ferguson would play at the nuptials.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  The actress Prince Harry looks set to pop the question to could not be more suited, say pals - because her student days were perfect training to keep up with the playboy prince.  While 36-year-old Meghan Markle may seem like the ideal princess-in-waiting, we can reveal she had a wild youth just like 32-year-old Harry.  Meghan’s days at Northwestern University in Chicago in the early 2000s have rarely been spoken about.  But a visit to her old stomping ground by the Sunday Mirror has revealed she was a typical party-loving student who allegedly used fake ID to go clubbing.  One of her favourite haunts is said to have been a bar that has since been shut down following a battle with authorities over underage drinking.  We also uncovered an article from the college news magazine in which Meghan herself joked she put on a stone after bingeing on Burger King in her Freshman year.  Interviewed by the magazine in 2014, after returning to the Northwestern campus for a Q&A session alongside fellow cast members of TV show Suits, she said: “It’s surreal because I haven’t been back since I graduated.  “And as I’m walking around I remember things like the schlep of getting to South Campus from up north.  “The 24-hour Burger King also ­definitely helped me put on the Freshman Fifteen.”  (Image: Coleman-Rayner)  Meghan attended the university’s School of Communication at the same time as fun-loving Prince Harry was getting into trouble for heavy drinking.  In his late teens, the young prince was making headlines for his wild nights out in Gloucestershire pubs around Highgrove – Prince Charles’s country home.  One pub in particular, the Rattlebone Inn, which has since changed hands, was infamous for its boozy lock-ins.  Prince Harry even set up a nightclub for his posh friends in the basement of Highgrove, calling it Club H.  And while the prince partied with his exclusive group of pals, Meghan was at college mixing with members of her own posh pack.  Hers was an all-female society, called the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, with a reputation for hard partying and social climbing.  Current KKG member Melania Hidalgo told the Sunday Mirror that Meghan had been a popular member of the student body.  (Image: Coleman-Rayner)  She said: “We’re intelligent hot messes. The thing we all have in common is that we’re all very driven, ambitious and passionate.  “Meghan was the recruitment chair of the sorority during her time here.  “She was in charge of bringing in new girls – you have to be a very friendly and outgoing person for that role.  “I lived in the house for a year and it’s a very fun experience, you end up becoming friends with people you never thought you’d mix with.  (Image: Coleman-Rayner)  “All of the late nights, and coming home from going out, watching movies… you develop very strong friendships.”  Meghan is not the only famous actor to have graduated from Northwestern. David Schwimmer, Warren Beatty, Stephen Colbert, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Zach Braff also learned their trade at the school.  Former pals told how Meghan had her eyes firmly set on Hollywood even back then – and would often sneak off for secret auditions for TV commercials.  Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now  But she still found time to let her hair down in the Windy City. One former student claimed: “Meghan had a fake ID during her time at university and told us about it when she visited the campus in 2014. She said she used it to drink at The Keg, which was a popular student bar for years, and she also got a job at a club in the city.  “You can get two fake IDs for about $100 in Chicago – it’s a little bit sketchy though and not everyone has one.  (Image: GC)  “She seems like the perfect modern princess now, but she lived university life like most teenagers and was really popular on campus. Everyone talks about her going here.” The Keg of Evanston later lost its liquor licence – after 36 years as a students’ favourite – following a battle with city officials over underage drinking.  It is now a trendy bar and restaurant, Bangers and Lace, and new management say The Keg will not be missed.  “It was a sh**hole, full of underage girls drinking and crazy boys starting fights,” general manager Chris Nora said. “It doesn’t surprise me Meghan had a fake ID.  (Image: WireImage)  Door staff used to joke when girls finally handed over a real one, saying, ‘It’s about time!’”  Already an accepted part of the family, Meghan is in the UK this week to give Prince Harry much-needed support on the 20th anniversary of mum Diana’s death . She spent the anniversary behind closed doors at Kensington Palace, sharing the difficult time with Harry and his brother William, along with William’s wife Kate and Harry’s nephew and niece, George, four, and Charlotte, two.  Our trip to Northwestern also shed some light on the mystery surrounding Meghan’s birth name, Rachel. For while the world knows her as Meghan, that is actually her middle name.  Rachel is the name given by her parents Thomas and Doria.  And photos discovered in the KKG house on campus show one picture of the actress captioned “Rachel Markle” – and another captioned “Meghan Markle”.  The find suggests it was during her college years that she switched her names.  And as speculation grows that the world’s most eligible bachelor could be about to pop the question, Meghan Markle is the name that will soon be known in every corner of the globe.\n",

Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Two weeks ago, an alleged supporter of the Islamic State group went on trial in London, accused of encouraging attacks on the four-year-old prince. Prosecutors said Husnain Rashid—a 32-year-old former mosque teacher in northwest England—provided an \"e-toolkit for terrorism\" and encouraged attacks on a range of targets, including \"injecting poison into supermarket ice creams and targeting Prince George at his first school.\"  The Guardian reports that one of Rashid's posts included a photo of George, his school, and the message, \"Even the royal family will not be left alone.\" Last week, after previously saying he did nothing wrong, Rashid admitted to a number of terror offenses, including encouraging terrorism, according to CNN.  Getty Images  Prince George—the eldest child of Prince William and Kate Middleton, and third in line for the throne—was recently seen at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding on May 19, where he served as a page boy. He was more recently spotted with his mother and sister, Princess Charlotte, for an outing in Norfolk, England, last week.  According to TMZ, Prince George's next appearance will be at Trooping the Colour on Sunday with the rest of the royal family at Buckingham Palace.

An insider said, 'Kate and Meghan bonded over the men they married. Now they're bonding over being pregnant together.'  While the pregnancies are the subject of plenty of palace buzz, In Touch reveals the duchesses have only shared the news with close family and friends.  For Meghan, the US publication claims the pregnancy is not just a huge joy but an 'enormous relief.'  'She was a nervous wreck about conceiving,' a palace insider says, not only because of her age but 'because it didn't happen with her first husband,' producer Trevor Engelson, from whom she split in 2013 after two years of marriage and nine years as a couple.  In Touch  The pressure to give husband, Prince Harry, children 'felt like a huge weight on Meghan's shoulders,' says the source.  'Everyone expected her to get pregnant immediately.'  Meanwhile Prince William, 36, was 'initially shocked when Kate told him he's going to be a dad again', but now he sees it as a 'happy surprise.'  'He and Kate have always wanted four kids,' the source tells.  And this time around, adds the source, Kate gets to share her pregnancy journey with not only her young sister Pippa, 34, who is due with her first child in a few months, but her new sister-in-law, too.

            "text: They both looked so happy, and so relaxed. They were beaming as they said their vows, and luckily, no one came forward to provide any reason that they might not be married. (This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.)  It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan’s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud.  It somehow looked charming and just right.  The entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring.  There was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary mélange including the archbishop of Canterbury and — in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places — the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry.  Chosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry, who is African-American, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life.  His address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry’s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry’s life since his mother’s death had finally lifted.  It was a passage from the Song of Solomon: “Arise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The dress was a success: sculptural simplicity.  Photo  Our fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, is also watching, and she has a quick take for us on Meghan Markle’s dress.  It was absolutely simple: pure and sculptural, in double bonded silk cady with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train.  It was Meghan Markle’s wedding dress. It was by Clare Waight Keller, a British woman and the first female designer of Givenchy. And it was everything people had hoped.  This was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales. Instead, it placed the woman proudly front and center and underscored Ms. Markle’s own independence.  At the same time, it celebrated female strength, promoted a local designer and reached a hand across to Europe (where Ms. Waight Keller has a day job).  The five-meter veil was of silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, and contained embroidery representing the flora of all 53 Commonwealth nations.  Video  And it was entirely a surprise. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress, from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney, Ms. Waight Keller’s name had never come up. In the end, Ms. Markle outthought us all. As this starts, long may it continue.  And the After-Party Dress  The newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex departed Windsor for their evening reception at Frogmore House in a very James Bond fashion. The duchess wore a second dress by designer Stella McCartney. You can read our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman’s reaction here.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  A good time was had by all (even before the cocktails).  Photo  Unlike a lot of weddings — and certainly unlike Kate and William’s wedding, just seven years ago — the guests inside hung out in the aisles, air-kissing and gossiping. It’s a great royal-and-celebrity cocktail party! (Sadly without cocktails.)  Kate and William’s wedding was solemn, stately, stuffy, full of dignitaries, politicians, and the sort of boring personages known here as the great and the good.  But this looked totally fun for the guests — even more fun than, say, the Academy Awards — because no one was competing for anything and no one was forced to talk about their outfits to television reporters.  Part of the change in tone is down to the passage of time and to how much Britain, or perhaps the royal family, has changed in the last few years.  Another reason, of course, is that Harry, being the second son and not a future king, has the freedom to be more relaxed, less constrained by tradition, and less conventional than his brother. This wedding has nothing to do with dynasty, or ensuring the security of the royal line. (We hope they have kids! But only because it’s fun to have kids, not because it would be some sort of international crisis if they did not.)  This wedding had everything to do with two people who are totally into each other and wanted to have a great big happy celebration.  Oprah, Beckhams and Clooneys, oh my!  Photo  One of the great excitements about any wedding, of course, is the moment you learn who has been invited and who has not. Meghan and Harry’s list was kept secret, until the very moment that dozens of mysterious figures started to enter St. George’s Chapel.  It was very exciting. There was none other than Oprah Winfrey, in a snug pink dress, a pair of very cool sunglasses and a massive broad-brimmed hat spectacularly festooned with flowers. If anyone qualifies as American royalty, it is surely Oprah, with her ability to transcend race and background, and her great gift for openness and emotional candor.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Kate Middleton’s parents, Carole and Michael, were there. They have always done such a good job of wearing appropriate outfits, smiling tastefully and saying nothing.  There was Charles Spencer, the Earl of Althorp, Diana’s brother, perhaps known best for his active love life and his impassioned attack on the British media after his sister’s death.  It turned into Celebrity Central. George and Amal Clooney made their stately, Hollywood-y entrance (She was in yellow with an interesting train).  David and Victoria Beckham, a.k.a. Posh and Becks, came in and graced some people in the crowd with their conversation.  From an American bishop, an extraordinary speech.  Photo  For many people, the most striking thing was the sermon by the charismatic Bishop Curry, who preached a ringing message of love — with references to Martin Luther King Jr. and to the legacy of American slavery — with such joy and such enthusiasm that it was impossible not to feel joyful and enthusiastic right alongside him.  “Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm, for love is as strong as death; passion as fierce as the grave. It’s flashes of fire, of raging flame. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it out.” — Bishop Michael Curry.  It was as if a Southern Baptist preacher had suddenly wandered onto the set of “Downton Abbey.”  The speech began trending on Twitter, with people marveling at the spectacle of seeing such a man saying such things in such a place.  While reporters in the British press corps struggled to render the bishop’s remark that “we gotta get y’all married” (the BBC rendered it “you all”), they also pronounced themselves thrilled — and in a completely unironic way, which does not always come naturally to them.  “If Pippa was the unexpected star of Kate’s wedding, Michael Curry is the star of this one,” tweeted Fraser Nelson, editor of the conservative-leaning Spectator, which is about as tradition-bound as they come. “Wonderful, wonderful sermon,” he added.  Monica Drake, an assistant managing editor at The Times, writes that Bishop Curry’s address was a nod to Ms. Markle’s heritage.

He was almost entirely kidding.  “Harry, what does it take?” he asked.  Different people had different reasons for coming.  Denise Crawford, who was raised in Jamaica, traveled from her home in Brooklyn to attend a wedding she considered a historic event.  “One of the children of slaves is marrying a royal whose forerunners sanctioned slavery,” she said. “The lion is lying down with the lamb.”  Alexa Koppenberg had come from Germany because she didn’t trust her web browser. It crashed when she watched the 2011 wedding of William and Kate.  “I think it’s great that she’s half African-American,” she said of Meghan Markle. “I never thought it would happen, as Harry always dated blondes before.”  A TV takeaway: Get off the red carpet.  Photo  Margaret Lyons, one of our television critics, checks in from New York with a sense of how things played out on the air.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Red carpet coverage for awards shows, particularly the Oscars, is strained, frequently sexist and often cringe-worthy — yet it persists. But if the varied and even decent live coverage of the royal wedding has anything to teach us, it’s that moving off the red carpet is the way to go.  Three hours of breathless coverage before an event even starts is … a lot.  Starting at 4 a.m. Eastern, every major outlet and several minor ones began broadcasting, but because no one was interviewing the actual high-profile guests, there was a lot less fawning.  Instead, the BBC broadcast had a brief discussion of the value of poetry with George the Poet (who, yes, is a poet). There were explanations of heraldic iconography, and interviews with people who run charities supported by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.  The American networks were also largely genial, discussing floral design, Princess Diana, naves and what defines a “morning suit.” Everyone gushed about celebrity guests and Oprah’s early arrival.  Talking about fashion is fun and interesting when the people talking about it are fashion experts, not just celebrities. If there’s a lesson here, it’s this: The shift to a color commentary model, from the current locker-room interview one, is something all red-carpet coverage should embrace.  Welcome to Windsor (you probably should have stayed home).  Photo  Anyone who found themselves in England on Saturday and thought about hopping on a train and heading to Windsor at the last minute came to a quick conclusion: bad idea.  First, there were the eager royal fans who, having arrived perhaps days earlier, had already snagged all the good spots along the procession route.  That was in addition to the thousands of police officers, some on horses, with their sniffer dogs, their metal fencing, their vehicle recognition technology, their closed-circuit TV cameras, their helicopters and their marine patrols of the river.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Windsor was no place to fly a drone, either. The police designated the area an exclusion zone for low-flying traffic on Saturday.  More than 100,000 people were crowded into the little town today. No one is saying how much the security operation cost, but the current (unconfirmed) estimate is that it will come to as much as 30 million pounds.  That’s about $40 million, with the bill to be paid by British taxpayers.\n",

            "text: Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall rang in her 70th birthday on July 17, so what better time to look at one of the most important relationships in her life? The connection that she has with her two high-profile stepsons, Prince William and Prince Harry, is one that has evolved from some very dark times into something that those around them likely doubted they would ever see. By the time William and Harry were born, their father, Prince Charles, had not only long ago ended his relationship with Camilla, but he didn't see her socially as a friend, either. Charles and Camilla had been romantically involved in their early 20s, but Charles's naval career took him away to sea, and he ended the relationship. Camilla married her ex-boyfriend Andrew Parker-Bowles, and Charles wrote to his godfather, \"I suppose the feeling of emptiness will pass eventually.\"  The pair initially remained friends and lived near each other. The Parker-Bowles were regular visitors to Charles's country home Highgrove, and Charles was made godfather to their son Tom. When Charles and Diana got engaged, he stopped seeing Camilla socially, and so William and Harry never met her as young boys — but they certainly heard about her. When Charles and Diana's marriage broke down and they both sought affection elsewhere, Diana made her feelings about Camilla clear to her sons and so followed years of William and Harry's anger toward the woman Diana called \"Charles's lady.\"  Charles and Diana separated in 1992, and after five years, he made moves to introduce his sons to the woman he hoped would one day be his wife. In the Summer of 1997, Charles sat down with William and Harry, explained a little about their relationship, and broached the subject of them all meeting — but William especially was resistant, and Charles knew it would be best to leave it for the time being.  \"Diana made her feelings about Camilla clear to her sons and so followed years of William and Harry's anger towards the woman Diana called 'Charles's lady.'  Diana died two months later, which naturally meant for Charles that it was all about supporting his sons. Over the next year, Charles and Camilla kept their relationship low-key; it was easier to work on building the relationship between Camilla and the queen.  Over time, the princes could see that Camilla made their father happy. At the age of 16, William took charge of the inevitable and finally instigated a meeting in June 1998 at the London residence he and Harry lived at with their father, York House at St James's Palace. They spoke on their own for half an hour, and it was reported that it went well, but that afterward, Camilla came out and said \"I need a drink.\" They went on to meet for lunch and afternoon tea soon after and continued getting to know each other. Harry's first meeting with Camilla was more straightforward and came a couple of weeks later, over tea at Highgrove along with her children, Tom and Laura.  Over the next seven years, the relationship between Camilla, William, and Harry was built very slowly. When the boys organized a 50th birthday party for Charles in November 1998, they invited Camilla to sit with Charles, although their relationship at that point was still very tentative. Camilla started to stay over at York House when William and Harry were in town, but when they were all at Highgrove together, she would drive back to her own house nearby after dinner, out of respect for the fact that it used to be Diana's house, too.  By the time Charles and Camilla married in 2005, things were significantly better between the two boys and Camilla. Shortly afterward, Harry said in an interview, \"She's a wonderful woman, and she's made our father very, very happy, which is the most important thing. William and I love her to bits.\" A further 12 years on from the wedding, and the brothers have now developed a warm, respectful, and loving relationship with their stepmother. It's telling that Camilla's granddaughter Eliza Lopes was a bridesmaid at William and Kate's wedding, and Harry even brought along a toy for her to play with. Camilla and Kate are also close. When Kate got married, Camilla gave her a special bracelet inscribed with both of their initials and has been best-placed to guide her through the ups and downs of marrying into one of the most famous families in the world.\n",

REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque  You can't say he wasn't warned.  Last week, former royal butler Grant Harrold spoke to ITV News about all the ways Trump could offend the Queen on his controversial visit to the UK.  One piece of advice was to always let the Queen take the lead when walking around — but it would seem the tip fell on deaf ears.  In a truly cringe-worthy viral clip, President Trump is seen breaking etiquette by walking in front of the Queen and then blocking her off when he stops, forcing Her Majesty to manoeuvre around him.  This breach of royal protocol led to outrage on Twitter as people called out the president for his lack of awareness.  Trump was visiting Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle (where Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were married) and took afternoon tea with the royal after they inspected the Coldstream Guards.  In an interview for The Daily Mail that took place on Air Force One, Trump raved about his meeting with the Queen: \"The Queen is fantastic!  \"She's a fantastic woman; so much energy and smart and sharp. She was amazing! Such a wonderful lady and so beautiful! It was such an honour to finally meet her. To have a Queen like that is great.\"  Although Trump was apparently happy to meet with the matriarch, many in the UK were not.  100,000 protestors flooded London's Trafalgar Square to object to the president's visit.  According to CBS, it was the largest weekday protest the city has seen in 15 years.\n",

It was announced Monday that Prince Harry, fifth in line for the British throne, will marry American actress Meghan Markle in the spring, confirming months of rumors. (Photo: AP)  LONDON — People around the world — from celebrity Kim Kardashian to regular folks — rushed to congratulate Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle on their engagement Monday. But many here, where the royal family resides, reacted in British ho-hum fashion.  \"I'm happy for the geezer, but I don't care,\" John Hedge, 42, said on a street in Streatham, a mixed-income neighborhood in south London.  That low-key response, expressed by others in the British capital, matched the way Harry said he popped the big question: while they were cooking a roast chicken during a \"standard, typical night\" at their cottage on the grounds of Kensington Palace.  \"Not interested,\" said Tony Jones, a commuter rushing to a train at London's Victoria station Monday evening.  Other Britons took to social media to ask whether the engagement would mean an extra day off — it won't. \"Give us the bank holiday or else,\" wrote Owen Jones, a left-wing newspaper columnist who believes the monarchy should be abolished.  Prime Minister Theresa May's office said the wedding day — sometime in the spring — will not be a national holiday, in contrast to the 2011 nuptials of Harry's older brother and future king, Prince William and Duchess Kate.

Markle, who is biracial, will be the first non-white person to marry into the royal family in modern history, a fact that sparked debate about interracial marriages in the United Kingdom.

Her husband, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is expected to become king of the United Kingdom and 15 other Commonwealth realms, making Catherine a likely future queen consort.[2]  Catherine grew up in Chapel Row, a village near Newbury, Berkshire, England.[3] She studied art history in Scotland at the University of St Andrews, where she met William in 2001. Their engagement was announced in November 2010. They married on 29 April 2011 at Westminster Abbey. The Duke and Duchess's children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis of Cambridge, are third, fourth, and fifth in the line of succession to the British throne.[4][5][6][7][8]  The Duchess of Cambridge's charity works focus mainly on issues surrounding young children, addiction, and art. To encourage people to open up about their mental issues, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry initiated the mental health awareness campaign \"Heads Together\" in April 2016.[9]  The media has called Catherine's impact on British and American fashion the \"Kate Middleton effect\".[10] In 2012 and 2013, Time magazine selected her as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World.[11][12]  Early life  Catherine Elizabeth Middleton was born at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading on 9 January 1982 into an upper-middle-class family.[13][14][15][16][17] She was baptised at St Andrew's Bradfield, Berkshire, on 20 June 1982.[18][20] She is the eldest of three children born to Michael Middleton (b. 1949),[21] and his wife, Carole (née Goldsmith; b. 1955),[22] a former flight dispatcher and flight attendant, respectively, who in 1987 founded Party Pieces, a privately held mail order company that sells party supplies and decorations with an estimated worth of £30 million.[23][24][25] Her father's family has ties to British aristocracy and benefited financially from trust funds which they established over 100 years ago.[26][27][14][28] Her Middleton relatives were reported as having played host to British royalty \"as long ago as 1926\".[29][30] She has a younger sister, Pippa, and a younger brother, James.[31]  The family lived in Amman, Jordan, from May 1984 to September 1986 where her father worked for British Airways (BA). Middleton attended an English-language nursery school.[32][33] When her family returned to Berkshire in 1986, she was enrolled aged four at St Andrew's School, a private school near Pangbourne in Berkshire. She boarded part-weekly at St Andrew's in her later years.[34] She studied at Downe House School.[35] She was a boarder at Marlborough College, a co-educational independent boarding school in Wiltshire,[36][37] and graduated in 2005 from the University of St Andrews in Fife, Scotland, with an undergraduate MA (2:1 Hons) in the history of art.[38] Before university, during a gap year, she travelled to Chile to participate in a Raleigh International programme, and studied at the British Institute of Florence in Italy.[39] In November 2006, Middleton worked as an accessory buyer with the clothing chain Jigsaw,[40] where she worked part-time until November 2007. She also worked until January 2011 at the family business in catalogue design and production, marketing, and photography.[18][41] Prior to her marriage, Middleton lived in an apartment owned by her parents in Chelsea, London, which was estimated to be worth £1–1.4 million.[42] In 2018, Catherine's total net worth was estimated at £5–7.3 million, most of which is from her parents' company.[42]  Relationship with Prince William  Early relationship  In 2001, Middleton met Prince William while they were students in residence at St Salvator's Hall at the University of St Andrews.[43] She reportedly caught William's eye at a charity fashion show at the university in 2002 when she appeared on the stage wearing a see-through lace dress.[44] The couple began dating in 2003, although their relationship remained unconfirmed.[45] During their second year, Middleton shared a flat with William and two other friends.[46] On 17 October 2005, Middleton complained through her lawyer about harassment from the media, stating she had done nothing significant to warrant publicity.[47]  Middleton attended Prince William's Passing Out Parade at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst on 15 December 2006.[48][49] Media attention increased around the time of her 25th birthday in January 2007, prompting warnings from both the Prince of Wales and Prince William and from Middleton's lawyers, who threatened legal action. Two newspaper groups, News International, which publishes The Times and The Sun; and the Guardian Media Group, publishers of The Guardian, decided to refrain from publishing paparazzi photographs of her.[50]  In April 2007, Prince William and Middleton split up. The couple decided to break up during a holiday in the Swiss resort of Zermatt.[51] Newspapers speculated about the reasons for the split, although these reports relied on anonymous sources. Middleton and her family attended the Concert for Diana in July 2007 at Wembley Stadium,[46] where she and Prince William sat two rows apart. The couple were subsequently seen together in public on a number of occasions and news sources stated that they had \"rekindled their relationship\".[52] Her long-term relationship with William before the marriage earned her the nickname \"Waity Katie\" in the tabloid press.[46]  On 17 May 2008, Middleton attended the wedding of Prince William's cousin Peter Phillips to Autumn Kelly, which the prince did not attend.[53] On 19 July 2008, she was a guest at the wedding of Lady Rose Windsor and George Gilman. Prince William was away on military operations in the Caribbean, serving aboard HMS Iron Duke.[54] In 2010, Middleton pursued an invasion of privacy claim against two agencies and photographer Niraj Tanna, who took photographs of her over Christmas 2009.[55] She obtained a public apology, £5,000 in damages, and legal costs.[56]  Engagement and marriage  The newly married Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the balcony of Buckingham Palace (2011)  Prince William and Catherine Middleton became engaged in October 2010, in Kenya, during a 10-day trip to the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy to celebrate his passing the RAF helicopter search and rescue course.[57][58] Clarence House announced the engagement on 16 November 2010.[57][59] Prince William gave Middleton the engagement ring that had belonged to his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. The couple married in Westminster Abbey on 29 April 2011[60] (St. Catherine's Day), with the day declared a bank holiday in the United Kingdom. Estimates of the global audience for the wedding ranged around 300 million or more, whilst 26 million watched the event live in Britain alone.[61][62][63] On marriage, Catherine assumed the style \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge\".[64]  In October, several months after the wedding, Commonwealth leaders pledged that they would implement changes in British royal succession law to adopt absolute primogeniture, meaning the first child of the Duke and Duchess, whether male or female, would be next in line to the throne after their father.[65]  Motherhood and children  William and Catherine with their first son the day after his birth (2013)  On 3 December 2012, St James's Palace announced that the Duchess was pregnant with her first child. The announcement was made earlier in the pregnancy than is usual as she had been admitted to King Edward VII's Hospital suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness. She remained in the hospital for three days.[66][67] On 14 January 2013, St James's Palace announced that the child was due to be born in July 2013, and that the Duchess's condition was improving.[68] The Duchess was admitted to St Mary's Hospital in London in the early stages of labour on the morning of 22 July 2013 and gave birth to Prince George later that day.[4][5]  The Duchess's second pregnancy was announced on 8 September 2014.[69] As with her first pregnancy, the Duchess suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum that required her to cancel official engagements.[70] On 2 May 2015, she gave birth to Princess Charlotte.[6][71]  On 4 September 2017, the Duchess's third pregnancy was announced. She was again forced to cancel engagements due to hyperemesis gravidarum.[72] Prince Louis was born on 23 April 2018.[73]  Public life  Middleton's first public appearance with Prince William following the announcement of their engagement was at a fundraising event organised by the Teenage Cancer Trust in December 2010.[74] She was formally introduced to public life on 24 February 2011, two months before the wedding, when she and Prince William attended a lifeboat-naming ceremony in Trearddur, Anglesey, in North Wales.[75] A day later they appeared in St Andrews to launch the university's 600th anniversary celebrations.[76] In March 2011, the couple toured Belfast.[77] Their last public engagement before the wedding was a visit to Darwen Aldridge Community Academy.[78][79] On 16 February 2011, Clarence House announced the couple's first royal tour of Canada would take place in July 2011.[80] In May 2011, shortly after the wedding, Clarence House announced the Duke and Duchess would extend their tour to visit California.[81] This was to be the Duchess's first visit to the United States.[82]  Catherine and William meet the Obamas at Buckingham Palace two weeks after their wedding (2011)  The Duchess's first official engagement after the wedding came in May, when she and her husband met Barack Obama, the President of the United States, and First Lady Michelle Obama.[83] On 26 October 2011, she undertook her first solo event for In Kind Direct, stepping in for the Prince of Wales, who was in Saudi Arabia.[84] On 2 November, the Duke and Duchess visited the UNICEF Supply Division Centre for supplying food to malnourished African children in Copenhagen, Denmark.[85][86] On St. Patrick's Day, 17 March 2012, the Duchess carried out the traditional awarding of shamrocks to the Irish Guards at their base in Aldershot; this was her first solo military engagement.[87] On 19 March, she gave her first speaking engagement for the opening of the Treehouse, a new children's hospice opened by East Anglia's Children's Hospices (EACH), a charity of which she is a patron.[88]  In June 2012, The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry was renamed The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, to reflect Catherine's contribution to the charity.[89] The Duke and Duchess were announced as ambassadors for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, alongside Prince Harry.[90] As part of her role, the Duchess attended numerous sporting events throughout the games.[91] In September 2012, the Duke and Duchess embarked on a tour of Singapore, Malaysia, Tuvalu, and the Solomon Islands as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.[92] During this overseas visit, she made her first official speech abroad, while visiting a hospice in Malaysia, drawing on her experience as patron of East Anglia's Children's Hospices.[93][94]  After the birth of Prince George, the Duchess carried out her first engagement in late August when she accompanied the Duke to meet runners preparing for an ultra-marathon on the isle of Anglesey, where they had a residence.[95][96] At the beginning of March 2014, details were announced of the half-month-long tour to New Zealand and Australia that the couple and their son would be taking from 16 to 25 April.[97] The tour was Catherine's first visit to the area and Prince George's first major public appearance since his christening in October 2013.[98] The tour began in New Zealand where they visited Wellington, Blenheim, Auckland, Dunedin, Queenstown and Christchurch. It ended in Australia where they visited Sydney, the Blue Mountains, Brisbane, Uluru, Adelaide, and Canberra.[99] In June 2014, the couple visited France to attend the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Normandy landings at Gold Beach.[100]  On 21 July 2014, it was announced that the Duchess would be making her first solo trip, visiting the island of Malta on 20–21 September 2014, when the island was celebrating its 50th independence anniversary.[101] Her trip was cancelled, with the Duke taking her place, after the announcement of her second pregnancy in early September.[102] In December 2014, the couple visited the United States and attended a charity dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[103] In April 2016, the Duchess and her husband undertook a tour to India and Bhutan.[104] The Duke and Duchess toured Canada again in September 2016.[105] Countries visited by the couple in 2017 include France, Poland, Germany, and Belgium.[106][107][108][109] The Duchess also visited Luxembourg City in May 2017 for the Treaty of London commemorations.[110] In January 2018, the couple visited Sweden and Norway.[111]  Charity work  Patronages  In March 2011, the Duke and Duchess set up a gift fund held by The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry to allow well-wishers who wanted to give them a wedding gift to donate money to charities they care about instead.[112][113] The gift fund supported 26 charities of the couple's choice, incorporating the armed forces, children, the elderly, art, sport and conservation. These causes were close to their hearts and reflected the experiences, passions and values of their lives.[114][115]  The Duchess of Cambridge's charity works focus mainly on issues surrounding young children, addiction, and art.[116] She has a number of patronages: The Art Room, National Portrait Gallery, East Anglia's Children's Hospice, Action on Addiction, Place2Be, Natural History Museum, Anna Freud Centre, Sportsaid, and The 1851 Trust.[117][118][119] The Duchess, who was an art student, takes an interest in art and handpicked the Art Room, which \"helps disadvantaged children express themselves\" through art therapy, and the National Portrait Gallery.[120] In her capacity as patron of Action on Addiction, the Duchess has occasionally made visits to its centres, spending time with recovering addicts.[121] The Duchess is joint Patron of 100 Women in Hedge Fund's Philanthropic Initiatives, along with Prince William and Prince Harry.[122] She is also a local volunteer leader with the Scout Association in north Wales,[123] of which the Queen is patron, and the Duke of Kent is president.[116] It aims to provide activities to over 400,000 young people in the UK.[116]  In October 2012, the Duchess gave her royal patronage to the M-PACT programme (Moving Parents and Children Together), one of the only UK programmes to focus specifically on the impact of drug addiction on families.[124] In December 2015, she assumed the patronage of the Royal Air Force Air Cadets[125] for youths 12–19 years of age. The Duke of Edinburgh, who had been patron of the RAF Cadets for 63 years, formally handed over during an audience at Buckingham Palace.[126] In 2017, she replaced the Queen as patron of The Lawn Tennis Association,[127] All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club,[128]and Action for Children.[129]  In January 2018, locks of her hair were reportedly donated to the Little Princess Trust, a charity which makes wigs for children diagnosed with cancer.[130] In February 2018, the Duchess became the patron of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.[131][132] She also launched Nursing Now, a three-year worldwide campaign to raise awareness about the profile of nurses. She said the campaign was personal to her as both her grandmother and great-grandmother were volunteer nurses.[133][131][132][134] In March 2018, Kensington Palace announced the Duchess of Cambridge would become the first royal patron of the Victoria and Albert Museum.[135][136]  Advocating for mental health  Catherine, who has tackled issues surrounding mental health and disabilities, has made visits to charities and hospitals such as St Thomas' Hospital and Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute to spend time with mothers and children who deal with these issues.[137][138][139] To encourage people to open up about their mental health issues, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry initiated the mental health awareness campaign \"Heads Together\" in April 2016. The Duchess later voluntarily talked about her problems as a mother, and admitted that she suffered a \"lack of confidence\" and \"feelings of ignorance\" during certain periods of time.[9][137][140]  The Duchess of Cambridge also launched the Mentally Healthy Schools, a project which helps the students and staff with access \"to reliable and practical resources to improve awareness, knowledge and confidence in supporting pupils' mental health.\"[141] Benita Refson, president of Place2Be, one of Catherine's patronages, has praised the Duchess's work saying she would help \"shine the spotlight on child mental health.\"[142] In February 2016, she travelled to Edinburgh to promote the work of Place2Be, launched Children's Mental Health Week, and contributed to the HuffPost UK as a part of the Young Minds Matter movement, an effort \"to raise awareness for children's mental health issues.\"[143][144] The Duke and Duchess later met with members and representatives of Young Minds and Youthscape to promote their mental health campaign.[145] In recognition of their work with charities concerned with children's mental health, the Duchess and her husband were awarded the Gold Blue Peter badge, an award previously granted to the Queen.[146] During a speech at the Royal Foundation forum in 2018, the Duchess said she would continue her work to raise awareness for mental health and said that \"The mental health of children and adults is one area where a long-term view will make all the difference to future generations.\"[147]  Public image and style  Middleton, prominent for her fashion style, has been placed on numerous \"best dressed\" lists.[148][149] The Daily Telegraph selected her as the Most Promising Newcomer on its 2006 list of style winners and losers.[150] Tatler placed her at number eight on its yearly list of the top ten style icons in 2007.[151] People featured her on its 2007 and 2010 best-dressed lists.[152] Middleton was named one of Richard Blackwell's ten Fabulous Fashion Independents of 2007.[153] In June 2008, Style.com selected her as its monthly beauty icon.[154] In July 2008, Vanity Fair included her on its international best-dressed list.[155] In February 2011 the Global Language Monitor named her the Top Fashion buzzword of the 2011 season.[156] In January 2012, the Headwear Association voted her Headwear Person of the Year.[157] Middleton was number one on Vanity Fair's annual best dressed lists in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013; she also appeared as the cover star in 2012.[158] The Duchess was named to the International Best Dressed Hall of Fame List in 2014.[159] In 2014, she was already being regarded as a British cultural icon, with young adults from abroad naming her among a group of people who they most associated with UK culture. These included: William Shakespeare, Queen Elizabeth II, David Beckham, J. K. Rowling, The Beatles, Charlie Chaplin, Elton John and Adele.[160][161] In June 2016, she took part in her first magazine shoot for Vogue's centenary issue appearing on the cover.[162]  The \"Kate Middleton effect\"[10][163] is the trend that the Duchess is reported to have had on others in sales of particular products. While Catherine wears items from many new designers, she has also worn dresses by Catherine Walker, who designed many of Diana's favourite evening gowns and day suits.[164] She has worn outfits, hats and ensembles by many other fashion designers.[165][166] The brands she favours are noted in the media.[165][166]  The Duchess, who attended the 71st British Academy Film Awards, did not participate in Time's Up movement calling for women to wear black on the red carpet.[167] Royal protocol forbids members of the royal family from taking part in political movements but she wore a black sash and carried a black handbag as a variation to the informal black dress code.[168][169] In March 2018, together with the Countess of Wessex, the Duchess hosted the Commonwealth Fashion Exchange reception at Buckingham Palace during 2018 London Fashion Week.[170][171]  Privacy and the media  The death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in Paris while being chased by paparazzi in 1997,[172] influenced the Duke's attitude towards the media.[173] The Duchess and her husband have asked that, when off-duty, their privacy should be respected,[173] but the media has not always respected with their wishes.  In 2009, before her engagement to William, Middleton was awarded £10,000 damages and an apology from the photographic press agency Rex Features Ltd. after she was photographed playing tennis on Christmas Eve while on holiday in Cornwall.[174]  In September 2012, the French edition of Closer and the Italian gossip magazine Chi, published photographs of the Duchess sun-bathing topless while on holiday at the Château d'Autet[173] (a private château on a 260-ha estate 71 km[175] north of Aix-en-Provence). Analysts from The Times believed the photographs were taken from the D22 (Vaucluse) road half a kilometre from the pool—a distance that would require an 800-mm or a 1000-mm lens.[176] On 17 September 2012, the Duke and Duchess filed a criminal complaint with the French prosecution department and launched a claim for civil damages at the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Nanterre.[177] The following day the courts granted an injunction against Closer prohibiting further publication of the photographs and announced a criminal investigation would be initiated.[178] Under French law, punitive damages cannot be awarded[179] but intrusions of privacy are a criminal offence carrying a maximum jail sentence of one year and a fine of up to €45,000 for individuals and €225,000 for companies.[180][181] In September 2017, Closer was fined €100,000 and its editor Laurence Pieau and owner Ernesto Mauri were each fined €45,000.[182]  In December 2012, two Australian radio hosts, Michael Christian and Mel Greig, called King Edward VII's Hospital Sister Agnes where the Duchess was an in-patient for hyperemesis gravidarum. Pretending to be the Queen and the Prince of Wales, Greig and Christian spoke to a nurse on the Duchess's ward, enquiring about her condition. Following a hospital inquiry and a public backlash against the hoax, Jacintha Saldanha, the nurse who put the call through to the ward, committed suicide.[183] The radio hosts subsequently apologised for their actions.[184]  In February 2013, Chi published the first photos of Catherine's exposed baby bump, taken during her vacation on the private island of Mustique. The British press refused to publish the paparazzi shots.[185] While the Duchess was visiting the Blue Mountains in Sydney, a picture was taken of her bare bottom as her dress blew up. Many newspapers outside the UK published the picture.[186]  On 14 August 2015, Kensington Palace published a letter detailing what it stated were the \"dangerous\" and invasive efforts of the media to get paparazzi pictures of Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Jason Knauf, communications secretary to the Cambridges, wrote the letter to media standards organisations in various countries.[187]  Titles, styles, honours and arms  Titles and styles  Royal monogram  Catherine is, by marriage, a princess of the United Kingdom and entitled to the style of Royal Highness.[188] She is usually styled as \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge\".[189] When in Scotland, she is referred to as the Countess of Strathearn.[190] Northern Ireland is represented by a third title, Lady Carrickfergus.[189][a]  Honours  Medals  Commonwealth honours  Honorary military appointments  5 July 2011 – present: Canadian Ranger  Honorific eponym  Awards  Arms  In September 2013, the Queen granted a conjugal coat of arms to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, consisting of their individual arms displayed side by side, beneath a helm and coronet denoting the duke's status as grandson of the sovereign.[196] Below is shown the earlier grant of the duchess's personal arms, impaled with those of her husband.  Ancestry  The Duchess of Cambridge's father, Michael, and her paternal ancestors were from Leeds, Yorkshire. Her paternal great-grandmother, Olive, was a member of the Lupton family, who are described in the City of Leeds Archives as \"landed gentry, a political and business dynasty\"; previously unpublished pictures revealed in March 2015 that Olive Middleton had grown up on her family's Potternewton Hall Estate alongside her cousin, Baroness von Schunck (née Kate Lupton).[31][200][201][202][203] Catherine's paternal ancestors also include her great-great-grandfather, politician Francis Martineau Lupton (1848–1921), whose first cousin, Sir Thomas Martineau, was the uncle of World War II Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.[204]  The Duchess's maternal ancestors, the Harrisons, were working-class labourers and miners from Sunderland and County Durham.[205] Ancestors through her maternal line include Sir Thomas Conyers, 9th Baronet (1731–1810), who was a descendant of King Edward IV through his illegitimate daughter Elizabeth Plantagenet.[206] Other ancestors are Sir Thomas Fairfax (1475–1520) and his wife Anne Gascoigne, who was a descendant of King Edward III.[207][208]  Notes  ^ Even with the title Lady Carrickfergus, she is still mostly referred to as the Duchess of Cambridge in Northern Ireland, as per given sources.

            "text: On Saturday, Prince Harry, 33, and Meghan Markle, 36, will wed at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle in a ceremony officiated by . . . sorry, we almost fell asleep there. We know all those details. You know what’s much more fun to discuss than wedding logistics? Wedding drama.  And unlike many royal weddings, there has been no shortage of it, especially in the last week. Here’s all the gossip leading up to the year’s most anticipated nuptials:  What’s up with Meghan’s dad?  Thomas Markle Sr., 73, used to work as a TV lighting director and cinematographer and has since retired to Mexico. Much has been made of Meghan’s relationship with her dad, as he and her mom divorced when Meghan was 6. Thomas has never met Harry, but they’ve reportedly spoken by phone. An “insider” recently told People magazine, “Like any father-daughter relationship, there have been ups and downs over the years. But they are in a good place now.”  Then it gets confusing. In early May, Meghan’s half-brother (more about him later) sent a nasty letter to Harry, imploring him not to marry Meghan and calling it “the biggest mistake in wedding history.” The letter, obtained by In Touch magazine, claimed Meghan’s father had not received an invitation to the wedding. However, the palace released a statement at the time confirming that Thomas would walk his daughter down the aisle. So that was weird.  However, things fell apart this week when it was revealed that Thomas Sr. had been working with the paparazzi to stage photos of himself: Reading a book on Great Britain, getting fitted for a suit, etc. This did not go over well, as the palace had chastised the media for badgering him. On Monday, Thomas told TMZ that he regretted the photos, saying they were “stupid and hammy,” and said he would not be attending the wedding because of a recent heart attack. A day later, he changed his mind and said he would love to go. Then, he contacted TMZ once more to say that he had to undergo heart surgery on Wednesday, and he would officially not be attending.  Early in the week, the palace sidestepped commenting on this mess, as a spokesperson simply said, “This is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation.”  On Thursday, Markle finally weighed in: “Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.”  And what’s up with her half-sister?  Samantha Markle, 53, is Thomas Sr.’s daughter from his first marriage and lives in Florida with her three kids. She made headlines early in Meghan and Harry’s relationship when it was reported she was penning a tell-all memoir called “The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister.” (The two reportedly haven’t spoken in years.) Samantha also trashed her half-sister in interviews, calling her a “shallow social climber” only interested in fame. Later, she changed her tune, saying Meghan was “absolutely lovely.”  So guess who wasn’t invited to the wedding? Plus, Samantha admitted this week she was the one who persuaded their father to take those staged pictures, thinking it would help improve his image. This earned her a dressing-down from TV host Piers Morgan, who called her a “little vulture.”  Why did Meghan’s half-brother write such a cruel letter to Harry?  It’s unclear — maybe Thomas Jr., 50 (Thomas Sr.’s son from his first marriage) was upset that he was left off the wedding guest list? “Meghan Markle is obviously not the right woman for you,” he wrote to Harry, adding his half-sister was a “jaded, shallow, conceited woman that will make a joke of you and the royal family heritage.” Thomas Jr. later appeared to regret this, as he gave a follow-up letter to In Touch in which he begged Meghan for a wedding invitation, trying to guilt her with the line, “We are all still family.” We’re guessing that it did not work.  However, Thomas Jr.’s ex-wife, Tracy, and their sons, Tyler and Thomas, did not let that deter them — they recently landed in London, where they’ll be acting as wedding correspondents for “Good Morning Britain.”    Meghan Markle watches the closing ceremonies of the Invictus Games with her mother, Doria Ragland, in Toronto last year. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press/AP)  What about her mom?    Doria Ragland, 61, is a yoga instructor and social worker. Meghan is her only child, and they’re extremely close. Before the engagement, she met Harry, who proclaimed her “amazing.” Tabloids reported that Doria, who lives in Los Angeles, recently quit her job at a mental health clinic. (Hmmm, could she be moving out of the country sometime in the future?) It has been speculated that Doria could walk her daughter down the aisle. (Update: Prince Charles is actually going to do it.) Either way, she arrived in London earlier this week to spend time with Meghan and meet the royal family.  Is her ex-husband really producing a TV show based on their relationship?  Meghan married film producer Trevor Engelson in 2011; they split two years later. In September 2017, Deadline reported that Engelson was shopping a fictional TV comedy with the description: “Divorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London’s tabloid media, is next level.” Hmmm. The idea was apparently sparked when Engelson and another producer were talking about what could have happened if he and Meghan had kids.  However, the Sun recently reported that Engelson, after being persuaded by Meghan and some mutual friends, has put the project on hold — for now.  Is there any drama on Harry’s side of the family?  Have you seen “The Crown”? You have? Good. That’s probably all the intense Windsor drama you’re going to get. Because Harry and Meghan limited the size of their guest list — it still includes 600 people, so everyone can chill — some distant relatives who were invited to William’s wedding were not invited to Harry’s. The royals are trained in remaining tight-lipped about most drama, of course, so we don’t know whether these minor snubs have caused any problems.  What’s up with those rumors about Meghan and Kate feuding?  Meghan’s eloquence and openness have earned her comparisons to Harry’s late mother, Princess Diana, often called the “People’s Princess.” Several tabloids report Kate is jealous of this comparison and Meghan’s overall popularity with the family and public.  But some rumors are simply rumors, friends, as Meghan and Kate have shown no signs of fighting — in public, at least. They both attended a Royal Foundation event with their significant others in February, during which the foursome were asked whether they ever disagree.  William replied, “Ohhh, yes,” according to Vanity Fair. Harry elaborated: “I think it’s really good we have got four different personalities and we all have that same passion to make a difference. We have different opinions and they work really well [together].” He then noted that they are all “stuck together for the rest of our lives,” to which Meghan added, “Togetherness at its finest.”    Prince Harry, Meghan Markle and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, attend the first annual Royal Foundation Forum. (Chris Jackson/AFP/Getty Images)  What roles will William and Kate have in the wedding?  A few months after William said his younger brother had not yet asked him to be his best man — “It could be a sensitive subject,” he joked on a radio show — Kensington Palace announced that William would, in fact, return the favor that Harry did for him in 2011. Kate probably won’t have a formal role during the ceremony, according to a Vanity Fair source who said Meghan and Harry “just want Kate to be able to enjoy the day and not worry about anything.” William and Kate’s older children, George and Charlotte, will be in the wedding party, while young Louis will stay at home.  [Little royals George and Charlotte threaten to upstage everyone else at Uncle Harry’s wedding]  Are Harry’s exes invited to the wedding?  Probably! Harry is said to be on good terms with Cressida Bonas, whom he dated for two years, and Chelsy Davy, whom he dated on-and-off for seven. There’s also precedent: Several of William’s exes attended his wedding, and Prince Charles’s then-ex-girlfriend — now his wife, Duchess Camilla — attended his to Diana.  Which celebrities will be there?  Never forget that before she ascended to royalty, Meghan was a mere Hollywood celebrity. Several actors from “Suits,” the USA network legal drama that propelled her to fame, are expected to attend the ceremony: Gabriel Macht, Patrick J. Adams, Sarah Rafferty, Gina Torres and Rick Hoffman. All five Spice Girls — British royalty in their own right — likely will, too, along with Meghan’s pals Priyanka Chopra and Serena Williams. Despite their friendship with Harry, Barack and Michelle Obama will not be present.

            "text: The rumour: Meghan Markle had a secret first husband  Where you heard it: The National Enquirer  The report: Markle’s status as divorcée has never been in dispute, but according to a new “bombshell” Enquirer cover story (is there any other kind?), Prince Harry will be the ex-actress’s third kick at the matrimonial can. “How she HID PAST from Husband No. 2!” claims one scandalous cover line, referring to “Man-eater Meghan’s” ex Trevor Engelson. Inside, an unnamed source explains how Harry was “blindsided” by the news, which has been kept secret until now (per the NE), thanks to a “hush-hush annulment.”  Subscribe To Our Newsletters — And Get All Our Royal Coverage Straight To Your Inbox  The smell test: For the love of Liverpool — this stinks worse than the royal stables after derby day! Just for starters, if Meghan had been married before she married Trevor Engelson in 2011, why would she have felt the need to hide it? Back then she was a Hollywood actress, existing in a world where divorce is no biggie. It’s not like she could have been planning for her royal future (yes, MM may be calculated, but she’s not clairvoyant). And even if we run with this idea of a secret ex-hubby (whom The Enquirer never names, btw), wouldn’t we already know about him? For his recent book Meghan Markle: A Hollywood Princess, royal biographer Andrew Morton spoke to dozens of people who knew Markle long before she was one half of a commemorative plate design. So we’re supposed to believe that not one of them would have mentioned old what’s-his-name? Never mind the fact that even “hush-hush annulments” are a matter of public record. The Enquirer’s insider speculates that MI-5 (a.k.a. her Majesty’s Secret Service) probably “scrubbed the records” to conceal Markle’s past, which is totally something that MI-5 would try to do. Except that unless they have a time machine, this is a story with way too many loose ends. In summation: Either Meghan Markle does not have a secret first husband (smart money), or she does, and anyone who knows about it better sleep with one eye open.  The rumour: The Palace is freaking out about the steamy love scenes in the upcoming Meghan and Harry Lifetime movie  Where you heard it: Vanity Fair  The report: In case you are not already counting down the days, Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance is the upcoming Lifetime movie that depicts the couple’s courtship, including (per this preview), some between-the-sheets time, and one scene-stealing giraffe. It’s that first part that purportedly has the palace press office in a tizzy. “What I’ve heard is that they’re seriously worried about the sex scene,” the movie’s director, Menhaj Huda, told VF last week, adding that his info is on good authority, as his “wife’s best friend has been dating the palace press secretary.”  The smell test: What really reeks here is Huda’s indiscretion. Whatever insider info he did or did not receive via his wife’s connection, you can be sure he won’t be hearing anything else in the future. (Jeez, dude — it’s called protecting your source.) Is the palace “seriously worried” about this movie? It’s easy to see why Huda would want us to think that, since scandal sells. In truth, it’s probably a matter of relativity. Because sure, they’d probably prefer that a factually based account of Harry and Meghan’s premarital sex-fest wasn’t coming soon to a TV near you, but it’s not like it’s a documentary. On the scale of royal scandal — a 1 being Kate Middleton’s cork wedges and a 10 being Prince Charles’s tampon ambitions — this is a 2.  The rumour: Meghan’s mom Doria will tell all in an interview with Oprah  Where you heard it: The Mirror  The report: Last week, The Daily Mail reported that Markle’s mom visited Winfrey’s Santa Barbara Estate, where she stayed for six hours, and exited with gifts (presumably a bunch of the Big O’s favourite things). At the time, the reason for the visit was unknown, but now The Mirror is quoting an unnamed “US TV source,” who claims that the pair were brainstorming ideas for a TV appearance (well, duh). Apparently both women are keen to discuss the reaction to Meghan and Harry through the lens of racism: “It’s an issue close to both Oprah and Doria,” quoth The Mirror’s source, adding that the only thing needed now is a green light from Buckingham Palace.  Rumour Has It That Meghan Markle And Kate Middleton ‘Hate Each Other’s Guts.’ Is That Really The Case?  The smell test: Not to nitpick here, but can an interview really be a “tell-all” if the palace has to approve it? Historically, the royal family has espoused more of a “tell-none” approach to the media. Oprah (who has interviewed pretty much everyone on the planet) never sat down with Diana or Charles or Queen Lizzie herself. That said, Markle is at the forefront of a whole new era, particularly when it comes to royals and the public. Both Harry and Wills have done interviews recently, discussing personal details about their own mental health, and clearly the Queen approved those. Given that Doria has thus far kept her mouth shut (unlike many members of the Markle clan who have made a full-time job of trashing their world-famous relation in the press), it’s possible a (highly scripted) sit-down with Winfrey will be her well-earned reward.  The rumour: Prince Harry will wear a wedding ring  Where you heard it: E! News  The report: This will-he-or-won’t-he drama has been ongoing since the engagement announcement, but now a source is telling E! that the Royal Ginger Snap “does want to wear a wedding band.” Improbably, this is one matter that is not covered in the royal etiquette handbook, and is instead a matter of personal preference: The Queen’s husband Prince Philip does not wear a ring (no big surprise there), and neither does William, while is father, Prince Charles, does.  The smell test: The idea that there is no existing protocol on the subject of male finger bling is hard to fathom, but if that’s the case, this all smells pretty sound. E! has proven to have some pretty well-placed royal sources. Meghan’s feminism could mean that she believes rings are for both genders. And Harry is definitely more a jewellery guy than super-traditional Wills. If royal memory serves, he and Meghan wore matching bracelets even before they went public as a couple.\n",

            "text: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been dating since 2016, and most of the relationship was formed over a long distance. So now that they've made things official and are about to get married, it's fair to wonder if Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are living together now or if royal protocol has kept them under different roofs. The answer is not all that surprising.  When the couple first met, Suits was still filming in Toronto, which is where Meghan was posted up. To visit each other, the couple had to carry out an elaborate bait and switch plan to distract the paparazzi and keep their romance a secret, according to Us Weekly. Meghan would travel to London for events and they took vacations together, but it wasn't until late 2016 that the The Sun reported they were \"virtually inseparable\" and that Markle had \"practically moved in\" with Harry. By that time, the couple had made their relationship public.  An anonymous source also told the outlet, \"They’ve taken things to the next level. They’re practically living together. She cooks for him, he pops out to the gym and they’re just enjoying hanging out.\" For those who might be scandalized by the young couple living together before marriage, it's actually a lot more common than some might think -- even accounting for royal protocol.  A source told HollywoodLife last year, \"The royal family has had to move with the times in order to survive, and they are nowhere near as stuffy and old fashioned as they used to be. Prince William and Kate Middleton lived together before marrying, so it’s no shocker that Harry and Meghan plan to do the same.\"  WPA Pool/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Right now, they're living in Nottingham Cottage, a 1,300 square foot house on the Kensington Palace compound, according to People. Ken Wharfe, a former police protection officer for the family, told the outlet that it's a \"lovely, classic Victorian cottage.\"  He added that it's \"not very big, incredibly small,\" which is understandable by royal standards. Wharfe elaborated that the cottage, one of just a few at Kensington Palace, was originally used for estate staff, but in the past few decades has been occupied by family members. He added of the properties:  They are well restored, typical country cottages and originally used for the estate workers. In the past 40 years or so they’ve been accommodation for senior members of the household. They’ll be updated but there certainly wouldn’t be room for servants. Not far from there are apartments, almshouses that housed some of Princess Margaret’s staff.  Prince William and Kate Middleton also stayed in \"Nott Cott,\" as it's referred to by the British press, for two years whenever they were in London.  Chris Jackson/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  For their wedding, Queen Elizabeth is supposedly gifting the couple a house at Sandringham Estate, in Norfolk, which is where the entire royal family spends the holiday season. That house has 21-rooms, which might be fun to decorate and make into a home, especially if they eventually have children.  The catch? That home is about 110 miles from London, and it seems a little odd that the young couple would want to be that far away from the hustle of the city. Harry did grow up at Kensington Palace, and Markle seems suited to city life, so it's entirely possible that they'll stay in Nottingham Cottage and keep the Sandringham Estate house for country getaways.  Then again, there are reportedly no air conditioners in the cottage and, according to Vanity Fair, Kate Middleton set up an entire system of fans when she lived there, so who knows how long they'll last in London-town after the wedding.  Wherever they end up living, they'll likely be very happy. And in the worst case scenario, they can always ask the Queen for some central air!\n",

            "text: Prince Harry is certainly one the most beloved members of the royal family, but he almost gave it all up to live a normal life. During a candid interview with the Mail on Sunday, the 32-year-old revealed that he considered giving up his royal life after serving in the army. \"I felt as though I was really achieving something,\" he said of his time serving with the British Army. \"I have a deep understanding of all sorts of people from different backgrounds and felt I was part of a team. I wasn't a prince; I was just Harry.\"  When he was forced to leave his first tour of Afghanistan when his location was revealed by the press in 2008, Harry admitted that he went through a bit of a rough patch. \"I spent many years kicking my heels and I didn't want to grow up,\" he said, referring to his partying past. Once he finally got things together though, he seriously contemplated leaving the royal life behind, but his loyalty to his grandmother Queen Elizabeth helped him in his decision to stay. \"I felt I wanted out but then decided to stay in and work out a role for myself. We don't want to be just a bunch of celebrities, but instead, use our role for good.\" And he's certainly doing just that. Aside from creating the Invictus Games to help wounded veterans and their families, Harry has been following in his late mother Princess Diana's footsteps by carrying on her charity work.\n",

She said: “He had a crush on Rachel Zane two years before he met Meghan and the reason I know is because I was having drinks with one of his friends. “She told me she’d been on a night out with Prince Harry. He was single at the time, so she said, ‘Harry, who’s your ideal girl?’ And he said ‘Meghan Markle from Suits.’” Prince Harry is said to have organised a meeting with his dream woman after having asked mutual friend Markus Anderson, a close friend of the divorcee, to set up a meeting between the two in order to fulfil his Rachel Zane fantasies.  GETTY The smitten couple struggled to keep their hands off each other during their latest appearance  The meeting reportedly took place when the 36-year-old was in London in July last year to watch Serena Williams play tennis at Wimbledon. According to The Sun, Ms Nicholl's added: “He asked Markus if he could set up, not a date, but an opportunity for them to meet and that happened in one of the private rooms of Soho House. “There were about seven or eight of them altogether and it was a perfect opportunity for Harry and Meghan to come together in a really informal environment and actually talk. “She was funny, feisty, confident and she wasn’t swayed or knocked by the fact that he was Prince Harry.

            "text: LONDON -- The father of the former Meghan Markle says he talked politics with Prince Harry over the phone -- and Harry said he should give President Donald Trump a chance. Thomas Markle told broadcaster ITV on Monday that he had several phone conversations with Harry, including one in which the prince asked for permission to marry his daughter.  Markle said Mr. Trump was discussed at least once: \"Our conversation was I was complaining about not liking Donald Trump, he said 'give Donald Trump a chance'. I sort of disagreed with that.\"  Markle said he also asked his future son-in-law about Britain's 2016 decision to leave the European Union and got the impression Harry is comfortable with Brexit.  \"I think he was open to the experiment,\" Markle said.  Harry's press office declined to comment on Markle's televised interview, which could raise eyebrows because senior royal figures are scrupulously careful not to comment publicly on domestic or international political affairs.  Markle, who had been scheduled to walk his daughter down the aisle, missed the royal wedding in May due to heart problems. He told ITV he was \"doing much better\" and that he regretted missing the big event.  The 73-year-old Markle, who watched the wedding from California, says he was \"very proud\" but that \"the unfortunate thing for me now is I'm a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history rather than the dad walking her down the aisle.\"  \"I can't think of a better replacement than someone like Prince Charles,\" he says of Prince Harry's own father, who walked Meghan most of the way down the aisle on her wedding day. \"He looked very handsome and my daughter looked beautiful with him. I was jealous, I wish I had been there, I wish it'd been me. But thank God he was there and thank him for that.\"  He says the couple, now known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will probably seek to have children soon.  \"She's wanted children for a long time,\" he said.  Markle said he gave Harry permission to marry his daughter over the phone.  \"Harry asked for her hand on the phone and I said: 'You are a gentleman, promise me you will never raise your hand against my daughter and of course I will grant you my permission. \"'\n",

            "text: Thomas Markle has claimed that Meghan has totally cut him off after not speaking for over 10 weeks  The retired television lighting director stated he had no way of contacting his daughter after Royal aides cut off all telephone links in the wake of previous comments he made to the media regarding the Royal Family. Speaking to the Mail on Sunday, Mr Markle said: “I’m really hurt that she’s cut me off completely. “I used to have a phone number and text number for her personal aides at the Palace, but after I said a few critical words about the Royal Family changing Meghan, they cut me off.” He expressed his sadness over the fact he has no means of sending his daughter a card ahead of her birthday on August 4, stating that if he sent one to Kensington Palace it would just be “one among thousands”.  I’m really hurt that she’s cut me off completely Thomas Markle  He added that he will likely not be able to see his grandchild should Meghan and Harry have children in the imminent future. Expressing his anguish, he told the paper: “How tragic is that, to deprive a child of its grandfather because I said a few things critical of the Royal Family.” Mr Markle came under sharp criticism after it was revealed he was paid for a set of staged paparazzi photographs ahead of the Royal wedding in May. But he expressed his confusion after receiving contradicting advice on what to do in response to the scandal.  Mr Markle expressed his sadness that he may not be able to see his potential future grandchildren  He noted that a Royal aide had said the photos had “offended the Royal Family” and called on him to offer an apology. Prince Harry then reportedly contradicted this statement, noting it was “unnecessary” to issue an apology as it would only “drag the story out a few more days”. While noting that Meghan is still “everything” to him, he stated he had “just about reached his limit” with his daughter and the Royal Family. In a stark warning, he said: “They want me to be silent, they want me to just go away. But I won't be silenced.” He criticised Meghan for her “sense of superiority”, and noted he had helped make her into the “Duchess she is today”.

            "text: Duchess of Sussex redirects here. For the title, see Duke of Sussex  American member of the British royal family, and former actress  Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (born Rachel Meghan Markle; August 4, 1981), is an American-born member of the British royal family and a former film and television actress.  Markle was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and is of mixed-race heritage. During her studies at Northwestern University, she began playing small roles in American television series and films. From 2011 to 2017, she played her best-known role, Rachel Zane, on the American legal drama series Suits. As an outspoken feminist, Markle has addressed issues of gender inequality, and her lifestyle website The Tig featured a column profiling influential women. Her humanitarian work in the 2010s saw her represent international charity organizations. She has received recognition for her fashion and style, releasing a line of clothing in 2016.  From 2011 until their divorce in 2013, Markle was married to actor and producer Trevor Engelson. In 2017, she announced her engagement to Prince Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, and moved to London. She consequently retired from acting, closed her social media accounts, and started undertaking public engagements on behalf of the British royal family. Following their wedding on May 19, 2018, Markle became known as the Duchess of Sussex.  Early life and education  Rachel Meghan Markle was born on August 4, 1981, in Los Angeles, California,[1] at West Park Hospital in Canoga Park.[2] As of 2017, her mother, Doria Ragland, a social worker and yoga instructor lives in View Park–Windsor Hills, California.[1][3] Markle has often described a very close friendship with her mother.[4] Her father, Thomas Markle Sr., who lives in Rosarito, Mexico,[5][6] is a retired television director of photography and lighting director, whose profession resulted in his young daughter often visiting the set of Married...with Children.[7][8] Markle's parents divorced when she was six years old.[9][10] She has two older paternal half-siblings, Thomas Markle Jr. and Samantha Markle, from whom she is reportedly estranged.[11]  Describing her heritage in a 2015 essay for Elle, Markle states that her \"dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I'm half black and half white ... While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.\"[12]  Markle grew up in Hollywood.[13] She was educated at private schools, beginning at age two at the Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse.[14][15] At age 11, her successful campaign to get Proctor & Gamble to change a national television commercial she viewed as sexist was profiled by Linda Ellerbee on Nick News.[16] Though she was raised as a Protestant,[17] Markle attended Immaculate Heart High School, an all-girl Catholic private school in Los Angeles.[18] She then attended Northwestern University, where she joined Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and participated in community service and charity projects.[19][20] Markle graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 2003 with a bachelor's degree and a double major in theater and international studies.[21][22] She also served an internship at the American embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina,[22] and studied for a semester in Madrid, Spain.[20]  Acting career  Early in her career, Markle worked as a freelance calligrapher to support herself between acting jobs.[7] Her first on-screen appearance was a small role as a nurse in an episode of the daytime soap opera General Hospital.[23][24] Markle had small guest roles on the television shows Century City (2004), The War at Home (2006), and CSI: NY (2006).[24] She also took on several contract acting and modeling jobs, including a stint as a \"briefcase girl\" on the US game show Deal or No Deal.[7] She appeared in Fox's series Fringe as Junior Agent Amy Jessup in the first two episodes of its second season.[25] Markle had some difficulty getting roles early in her career. In 2015, she wrote: \"Being 'ethnically ambiguous', as I was pegged in the industry, meant I could audition for virtually any role ... Sadly, it didn't matter: I wasn't black enough for the black roles and I wasn't white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn't book a job.\"[26]  In July 2011, Markle joined the cast of the USA Network show Suits, playing Rachel Zane. The character began as a paralegal and eventually became an attorney. She completed work on the seventh season in late 2017.[27] According to a critique in The Irish Times, Markle deftly and \"actively re-positioned\" her character from ingenue to \"the show's moral conscience\" and gave viewers the unique portrayal of a daughter, whose African-American father is in a position to help her career and advance her \"desire to crack both racial and gender glass ceilings\".[28] She appeared in two 2010 films, Get Him to the Greek and Remember Me, and one 2011 film, Horrible Bosses.[29] She also appeared in episodes of Cuts; Love, Inc.; 90210; Knight Rider; Without a Trace; The League; and Castle.[24][30]  From 2014 to 2017, she was founder and editor-in-chief of the lifestyle website The Tig,[31][32] a name she derived from Tignanello red wine.[33] One of The Tig's features was \"Tig Talk\", a column that profiled women including Jessica Alba,[34] Gail Simmons,[35] Ella Woodward,[36] Daphne Oz,[37] Elizabeth Hurley,[38] Lauren Bush,[39] Ivanka Trump,[40] Dianna Agron[41] and Jessica Stam.[42] She closed The Tig in April 2017,[43] and in January 2018, she deleted all of her social media accounts. At the time of its closing, her Instagram account had 1.9 million followers.[44] In a statement issued by Kensington Palace, Markle thanked \"everyone who has followed her social media accounts over the years\".[45][46]  In November 2016, Markle and Canadian clothing company Reitmans released lines of women's fashion workwear and casual-wear.[47] The lines, based on her personal style, and that of her Suits character, described as \"aspirational girl next door\", quickly sold out.[44] In 2010, Markle was paid $187,000 for her role in Remember Me and $171,429 for her role in the short film The Candidate.[48] For her role on Suits, Fortune magazine estimated that Markle was paid $50,000 per episode, amounting to an annual salary of about $450,000.[49] In addition, it was estimated that as a lifestyle blogger she earned about $80,000 annually from endorsements and sponsorships.[48] In 2017, her total net worth was estimated at $5 million.[48] In 2018, she was among the nominees for the 2018 Teen Choice Awards in the category Choice Style Icon.[50]  Personal life  Markle began a relationship with actor and producer Trevor Engelson in 2004.[51][52] They married in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, on September 10, 2011,[53] and separated through a no-fault divorce in August 2013,[54] citing irreconcilable differences.[55]  Markle was in a relationship with celebrity chef and restaurateur Cory Vitiello for almost two years.[56] They lived together in their residence in Toronto.[57] Their relationship ended in May 2016.[56]  Markle and Prince Harry attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  In June 2016, Markle began a relationship with Prince Harry,[58][59] who was then fifth in line to the British throne.[60] Markle and Prince Harry met on a blind date set up by a mutual friend.[61] The press began to report on the relationship in October 2016.[62] On November 8, 2016, the British royal family's communications secretary released an official statement that addressed a \"wave of abuse and harassment\" directed toward Markle.[63] The statement described sexism, racism and defamatory stories directed at her.[64][65][66] During a September 2017 interview with Vanity Fair, Markle spoke in public for the first time about her love for Prince Harry.[67] Later that month, they made their first public appearance together at an official royal engagement at the Invictus Games in Toronto.[68][69]  While working on Suits, Markle lived in a rented house in the Seaton Village neighborhood of Toronto, Canada, where the show is filmed.[70] She lived in Canada for nine months each year, making a few close friends.[44] She moved out in late November 2017 after work on the seventh season had been completed.[71]  Markle has two rescue dogs, a labrador-shepherd named Bogart and a beagle named Guy, whom she adopted in 2012 and 2015 respectively.[72][73]  Royal marriage  Markle's engagement to Prince Harry was announced on November 27, 2017.[58][74] By then, she had met Queen Elizabeth II, Harry's paternal grandmother, several times.[75] The engagement announcement prompted generally positive comment about the possible social significance of a mixed-race member of the royal family.[76] The ring Harry gave Markle consists of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from the jewellery collection of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.[77] Following the engagement, Markle announced she would retire from acting,[78][79] and began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[80]  In preparation for the wedding, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, baptised Markle and confirmed her into the Church of England on March 6, 2018.[81] The private ceremony, performed with water from the River Jordan, took place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace.[81] The marriage ceremony was held on May 19, 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[82] The Duke and Duchess live at Nottingham Cottage in London, in the grounds of Kensington Palace.[83]  Public life  Markle greeting the public in Belfast, March 2018  Markle accompanied Harry for the first time during an official public appearance after their engagement at a walkabout in Nottingham on December 1, 2017,[84][85] in connection with World AIDS Day.[86] The Queen invited them to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at her Sandringham estate.[87] In early 2018, Markle accompanied Harry on his engagements in Brixton,[86] Cardiff,[88] Goldsmiths' Hall,[89] and Edinburgh.[90] On February 28, 2018, Markle attended an official engagement at the first annual forum of The Royal Foundation, \"Making a Difference Together\" with the prince.[91] She became the fourth patron, alongside Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, after her marriage into the royal family.[92] Markle and Harry marked International Women's Day by attending an event in Birmingham hosted by the Stemettes.[93] Along with the Queen and other members of the royal family, she attended the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on March 12, 2018.[94] The couple made their first visit to Northern Ireland on March 23, 2018.[95] Markle carried out a total of 26 public engagements prior to the wedding.[96]  The Duchess's first official engagement after the wedding came on May 22 when she and her husband attended Prince Charles' 70th birthday garden party to celebrate his charity work.[97] Her first trip abroad at the request of the British government was to Dublin, Ireland, in July 2018.[98][99] According to a review in The Irish Times, her visit became a unique national obsession.[100] In June 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the Duke and Duchess would tour Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand around the time of the Invictus Games which will be held in Sydney in October 2018.[101][102]  Fashion and style  Markle cited Emmanuelle Alt as her style inspiration in 2017.[103][104] In an interview with Glamour, the Duchess said that she favored \"that French way of styling, where if your outfit is pulled together, then something's got to be dishevelled—your hair, your make-up\".[103] In her youth, Markle's \"sensibility had always been relaxed California girl style\" consisting of jeans, cut-offs and flip-flops.[104] She usually prefers \"streamlined dresses\" with \"neutral colors\" and boat-neck necklines,[105][106] and likes \"monochromatic and tonal dressing\".[104] She has worn outfits and ensembles by many fashion designers.[103] The media takes note of the brands she uses.[103]  In December 2017, Markle caused a surge in interest in Scottish retailer Strathberry after carrying one of their handbags to a public event shortly after her engagement.[107][108] This was reported as an indication that her fashion choices would produce her own version of the Kate effect.[107][109] It has been speculated that Markle's effect would be greater, as she has a strong appeal in America.[109] After Markle and Prince Harry's first appearance as a couple, brands Mackage, Birks, R&R Jewelers, Crown Jewelers and Everlane noted an upswing in their website hits and sales.[110][111][108]  Charity work  Markle was

            "text: In February I saw a photo of Meghan Markle and the Duchess of Cambridge sitting next to each other at the Royal Foundation Forum, wearing colour coordinated dresses (lavender for Kate, deep purple-blue for Meghan). It wasn’t their dresses I minded, it was how they sat – legs crossed neatly at the ankle, knees pressed firmly together. It was that dulce et decorum pose passed down to generations of girls and young women expected to demonstrate their good breeding on social occasions – expected to show they are “ladies”. Both Kate and Meghan had folded their hands in their laps, the arms forming a gentle circle, the hands quietly clasped, as if ready to shelter a child or calm a kingdom’s cares. But it was the legs that haunted me – in part because I’d been taught that same bit of etiquette when I was a young black midwestern girl in the 1950s and early 60s, a child of the manners- and achievement-conscious black bourgeoisie, which in those days we called the Negro elite.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Meghan Markle and the Duchess of Cambridge at the Royal Foundation Forum. Photograph: Chris Jackson/AFP/Getty Images  In fact, things turned out better than I’d feared. In a subsequent photo Kate crossed her legs at the knee. And when both women were asked in the video about the causes they planned to take up, Meghan spoke out. The words “MeToo” and “Time’sUp” flowed from her lips. So did the words “I fundamentally disagree”, as in: “What’s interesting is … when speaking about girls’ and women’s empowerment you’ll often hear people say: ‘Well, you’re helping women find their voices,’ and I fundamentally disagree with that. Women don’t need to find a voice, they have a voice, and they need to feel empowered to use it, and people need to be encouraged to listen.”  Rachel Meghan Markle, for those who have chosen or somehow managed to miss the ceaseless chronicling of her life thus far, is the only daughter of Thomas Markle (white), an Emmy award-winning cinematographer and lighting designer, and Doria Ragland (black), a social worker and yoga instructor who focuses on community mental health. This union of white Hollywood and black social-spiritual activism made her the offspring of a modern and ever more varied biracial bourgeoisie.  The family settled in Woodland Hills, a prosperous Los Angeles neighbourhood. Prosperous and largely white: Meghan’s mother was regularly mistaken for her nanny there. This must have happened in the 80s and early 90s when she was a young girl; it still happens in the US to every black woman I know who has a mixed-race child.  Meghan’s parents divorced when she was six, and she lived with her mother after that, although she saw her father regularly. There are two half-siblings from his previous marriage, both quite a bit older. Relations with them, at least since the courtship and engagement, have been strained.  Timeline Prince Harry's relationship with Meghan Markle Show Hide  The pair meet in London through friends and begin a relationship. News breaks that the prince and Markle are dating. Kensington Palace confirms in an unprecedented statement that they are dating. The prince attacks the media over its “abuse and harassment” of his girlfriend.  Markle is spotted in London amid unconfirmed reports she is enjoying her first stay at Kensington Palace since the relationship was made public. Markle reportedly meets the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte for the first time in London.  The engagement looks set when Markle graces the cover of US magazine Vanity Fair and speaks openly about Harry for the first time, revealing: “We’re two people who are really happy and in love.” Markle makes her first appearance at an official engagement attended by the prince when she attends the Invictus Games opening ceremony in Toronto, Canada – although the pair sit about 18 seats apart. It emerges that the prince has taken Markle to meet his grandmother, the Queen, whose permission they need to marry. They met over afternoon tea at Buckingham Palace. The prince’s aides are reported to have been told to start planning for a royal wedding, with senior members of the royal family asked to look at their diaries to shortlist a series of suitable weekends in 2018. Markle is spotted in London, prompting speculation she is preparing for an engagement announcement. Clarence House announces the engagement, and the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh say they are “delighted for the couple and wish them every happiness”.  The couple marry before a celebrity-studded congregation at St George's Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle.    Markle majored in international relations and theatre at Northwestern University, Illinois. Besides becoming an actor, she became a feminist who worked for UN Women as an advocate for political participation and leadership. Yes, she has been praised and criticised as “outspoken”, but her style never risks being “aggressive” or “combative”, or any of the other words thrown at women who are deemed insufficiently graceful when they disagree with men. Even when she makes staunch political statements, her manner astutely – sometimes cloyingly – balances the forthright and the pleasing. She’s learned to use political maxims and assertions very effectively. As in: “It’s time to focus less on glass slippers and more on glass ceilings.” With the word “fairytale” now a ubiquitous tag line for the royal romance, this should be a useful daily mantra.  The Cinderella story refuses to dwindle into a period piece; in the last 20 years alone there have been six film remakes with white, black and Latina leads. But Markle has not been plucked from poverty or – like the heroines of such romcom adaptations as Pretty Woman and Maid in Manhattan – from the low-status toil and trouble of working-class life. Her net worth as an actor has been estimated at around $5m. An actor’s fortunes can fluctuate, especially when that actor is a woman. But so can the fortunes of a wife. If the royal marriage were to end in divorce, Markle would not have to depend on the Windsor millions nor, like many once-upon-a-time celebrities, design a skincare or jewellery line for QVC.  Any 'commoner' who marries into any royal family ​is seen as marrying up. But Harry is marrying up too, by marrying out  Love that results in the bride’s near magical social ascent is the key element in Cinderella tales. But is Markle automatically marrying up by marrying a prince? In the old school way, yes: any “commoner” who marries into any royal family is seen as marrying up. But Harry is marrying up too. He’s marrying up by marrying out – out of long-entwined bloodlines, out of entrenched rituals and hierarchies, out of a lineage as constricted as it is privileged. We always ascribe social ambitions to commoners, but aristocrats have their own longings for a world elsewhere. Harry is marrying into all the possibilities of postmodernity. It’s a world where – as Zora Neale Hurston said of black folktales and music – hierarchies, styles, sites of social and cultural change are being made and forgotten every day.  In this world-elsewhere that is here and now, Markle’s identities as a progressive biracial and black feminist are impeccable. When speaking of her role on TV series Suits, as the biracial lawyer with a black father, she said: “Some households may never have had a black person in their house as a guest, or someone biracial. Well, now there are a lot of us on your TV and in your home with you.” And now there are even a few of us in the castles you see on TV.  How would a global marketer for the royal family describe their marriage? Charles is not going to help the royal brand become fresh and contemporary. William and Kate are contemporary royals – unpretentious, decent and likable. But they do not suggest risk or daring. Today the House of Windsor is like a venerable and all too predictable fashion house. Its cultural currency depends on history packaged as costume drama: The Queen, The Crown, The King’s Speech, Darkest Hour. To flourish it must attract new designers, new ideas and new muses. And let me end my fashion analogy by noting that in March this year, Virgil Abloh, a Ghanaian American designer, was named artistic director of menswear for Louis Vuitton, a fashion house founded in 1854 when Queen Victoria was on the throne and the royal family had yet to be rebranded as the House of Windsor.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Prince and Markle pictured at Kensington Palace in November 2017, just after their engagement was announced. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters  ¶  Perhaps a better genre through which to read the complexities of the Meghan-Harry narrative is the romantic comedy. In the best romcoms, attraction is ignited by tension and difference. Thwarted too. The characters have to learn something from each other and something about themselves; negotiate across troublesome boundaries (gender and class privilege, temperament), and learn to take emotional risks.  For this union, Harry has had to renounce his protected status as a vivaciously shallow party boy whose transgressions took the form of booze-fuelled pranks, such as showing up at a friend’s birthday party in a Nazi desert uniform with a swastika armband (the party’s theme was “colonial and native”), or hosting a game of strip poker in a Las Vegas hotel room. Reformation followed in three stages, each appealing to a different constituency. He served in Afghanistan. He recently confessed to emotional and mental health problems that began soon after his mother’s death: a shutdown of feelings, bouts of rage and anxiety followed by psychological counselling.  Finally, there came his involvement with Markle. A professional woman, an educated woman, a 36-year-old divorced American woman, a woman of colour and a feminist whose presence in his life would soon require that he forcefully denounce racism and sexism in the British press (and, I trust, among his more un-woke friends and relations). “I’ve never wanted to be a lady who lunches – I’ve always wanted to be a woman who works,” Markle once said. In show business she worked her way up. She didn’t become a Hollywood superstar; she did become a skilled, well-paid lead in a highly rated TV series. She had a social conscience, which she acted on. And now, she is more famous and more influential than she was ever likely to be on her own. It remains the way of the world. Does Amal Clooney have more resources as a human rights lawyer and philanthropist now that she is married to George Clooney? No doubt.  Once a woman enters a royal family, every aspect and function of her body becomes a site of proprietary fantasy  Whatever we think of her new job requirements, Markle will remain a working woman with a lifetime of public performances ahead. Every word, every gesture, every detail of dress will be scrutinised and read for subtext. The touches of white on her navy J Crew coat? A tribute to the British suffragettes. Bare legs instead of tights for the engagement photos? A subtle flouting of royal dress proscriptions.  Once a woman enters a royal family, every aspect and function of her body becomes a site of proprietary fantasy. The female body as a nation’s procreative destiny: the only real change through the centuries is that fantasy has replaced realpolitik. For Diana Spencer, that meant her uncle certifying her virgin status in a tabloid newspaper interview shortly after her engagement to Charles. As if his niece’s body parts were a bride price to be flaunted, eliciting leers and cheers.  For Markle, it means media warnings that she is 36 years old and shouldn’t wait much longer. “Meghan, Oh Baby! Meghan and Harry Planning a Honeymoon Knock-Up” went one headline. Her former husband, producer Trevor Engelson, is also conjuring imaginary children. He has announced plans for a Fox comedy: “Divorce is hard,” goes its pitch. “Sharing custody is harder when an ex-wife marries a British prince. Sharing custody with the British royal family in the unforgiving spotlight of London’s tabloid media is next level.”  ¶  “Meghan Markle Looks Gorgeous With Naturally Curly Hair in Childhood.” The published photo was charming, as is the video of her at 11, with a curly frizzy ponytail, chastising the ad industry for its sexism. Many of us used to ask if we’d ever see Michelle Obama in an updated version of the afro she wore in her pre-public figure days. Many of us used to answer that the furore it would cause – the afro as proof of the first lady’s secret allegiance to white-hating black militants – probably wasn’t worth the gesture. And since a small dust-up followed Meghan’s recent appearance in a bun with wavy tendrils around her face, it’s hard alas to imagine how anything, including the claim of biographer Andrew Morton that she is a direct descendant of Robert the Bruce, would atone for a full display of those racially marked curly/wavy/frizzy locks.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Markle at her aunt’s wedding. Photograph: Mail on Sunday/Solo Syndication  But if she never wears her version of a natural, she has already done race history a real service. She has helped scuttle false, foolish constructs of “the mulatto” that were developed a few centuries ago to counter the very real threat that mixed-race people posed to the constructs of white supremacy. To serve popular culture, the female mulatto became a source of social and erotic intrigue, a figure who needed strict narrative policing. Stories, novels, plays and early films gave her two options.  She could be a scheming seductress (see Lydia Brown in DW Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation, the mistress of a gullible white abolitionist played by a panting and grimacing white actress). Or she could be tragic (as in Dion Boucicault’s The Octoroon of 1859, and Charles Chesnutt’s The House Behind the Cedars of 1900), a beautiful, seemingly white woman of faultlessly refined bearing, doomed by the taint of black ancestry. The tragic version attracts the love of a well-born young white man who does not know her secret. She tries – she hopes, she longs – to pass for white, and the ruse works for a time. But, when the innocent gentleman proposes marriage, the plot dictates that her shame be revealed and she must die, by her own hand or from a fatal disease.  Decades of scholarship and memoir have corrected and complicated this narrative, of course. Still it lingers and titillates, a handy tool for condescension, suspicion and breezy sneers. A key theme in these stories is the heroine’s terror that, if she marries her white hero, she might bear a child whose skin colour would reveal the dreaded racial truth. I imagine there’s plenty of spiteful, behind-the-scenes chatter about whether this “touch of the tarbrush” will taint Meghan and Harry’s offspring. Perhaps the “blackamoor” brooch that Princess Michael of Kent was photographed wearing on her way to a royal event with Harry and Meghan was meant to signify such a dread: Meghan as the black ewe tupped by a white ram, who will produce a shamefully black offspring.  And surely the Daily Mail was gesturing towards this when it ran a story about the ostensibly tawdry origins of Markle and her mother, titled: “Harry’s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton: Gang-scarred home of her mother revealed – so will he be dropping by for tea?” Doria Ragland was cast as “a dreadlocked African American lady from the wrong side of the tracks”. One whose career as a yoga instructor and social worker suddenly made her the equivalent of the mulatta’s disreputable mother, who gathers roots and practises hoodoo.  Early rumours had it that Ragland would walk her daughter down the aisle (with her usual dreads, I hoped). Now it’s reported that Markle’s father will, or that they will share the duty. I vote for Ragland alone. Still, to watch a divorced, interracial couple walk the royal red carpet has its own rewards when, once upon a time just 51 years ago, US law forbade their marriage.  Like any black and biracial woman, she has had a lifetime of learning to both confront and navigate codes  In 2015 Markle wrote an essay for Elle in which she quite eloquently established that she is both biracial and black. She started with the blunt racial slurs of her childhood, which turned, as she grew, into the patronising queries and assumptions favoured by adults who think themselves liberal. A perfect example was the teacher who told her to fill in “white” on a census because “that’s how you look, Meghan”. Intended as a compliment, no doubt. In the essay, she also discussed the institutional racism exposed by the police shootings in Ferguson and Baltimore. She recalled the flurry of racist tweets set off when Wendell Pierce was cast as her African American father on Suits: “Ew, she’s black? I used to think she was hot.” Then, having described both her struggles with, and her pride in, being biracial, she ended the essay with a tribute to her black ancestry.  “You create the identity you want for yourself, just as my ancestors did when they were given their freedom. Because in 1865 (which is so shatteringly recent), when slavery was abolished in the United States, former slaves had to choose a name. A surname, to be exact. Perhaps the closest thing to connecting me to my ever-complex family tree, my longing to know where I come from, and the commonality that links me to my bloodline, is the choice that my great-great-great grandfather made to start anew. He chose the last name Wisdom. He drew his own box.” Excellently done, I thought. She’s refusing to let white readers white out her black identity.  When it comes to issues of race, gender, sexuality and class, how much can Meghan Markle say and do? How much does she want to say and do? We simply don’t know yet. Like any black and biracial woman, she has had a lifetime of learning to both confront and dextrously navigate codes that range from the puzzling to the vehemently punitive. Like every actress she’s had to confront misogyny. But she has options that previous generations did not.  The speech she gave at the 2015 UN women’s conference began in rousing, declamatory mode: “I am proud to be a woman and a feminist”; moved to personal narrative (this part grounded in the story of how she organised her campaign against that sexist television ad at age 11); then built up to inspirational political exhortation. “It is said that girls with dreams become women with vision. May we empower each other to carry out this vision, because it isn’t enough to simply talk about equality, one must believe in it, and it isn’t enough to believe in it, one must work for it.” May the work recommence once the £32m wedding is done.  • On Michael Jackson by Margo Jefferson is published by Granta.\n",

            "text: It will be a huge lifestyle change. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle pictured. Ben Birchall - WPA Pool/Getty Images  The royal wedding is (almost) upon us. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tie the knot on Saturday, about two years after they were set up on a blind date by a mutual friend.  Markle's new life will look drastically different from her life before she met her future husband. Not only will she move from the United States to the United Kingdom and become a British citizen; she'll also transition from an acting career to being full-time royalty.  In the couple's first interview after announcing their engagement, Markle, who is 36 years old, addressed her decision: \"I don't see it as giving anything up, I just see it as a change.\"  She added that she had already been working on the television series \"Suits\" for seven years. \"So we're very, very fortunate to be able to have that sort of longevity on a series and for me, once we hit the 100-episode marker, I thought, 'You know what? I have ticked this box and I feel really proud of the work I've done there and now it's time to, as you [Harry] said, work as a team with you.\"  In addition to playing Rachel Zane on \"Suits,\" Markle also appeared on the soap opera \"General Hospital.\" She's been everything from a United Nations women's advocate to a freelance calligrapher, and she recently shut down her lifestyle blog, \"The Tig.\"  While nothing will expressly prohibit Markle from acting, INSIDER's Kristin Salaky and Talia Lakritz reported that royals are forbidden from being politically active and from publicly discussing their political views.  Markle and Prince Harry say they're on the same page about wanting to change the world  Markle's experience marrying into royalty isn't something most of us can relate to. But the general theme of making big life changes for your partner is universal.  As Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg frequently tells young women, \"The most important career choice you'll make is who you marry.\"  Legendary investor Warren Buffett said much the same thing in a conversation with Bill Gates at Columbia University. He told the audience: \"The most important decision many of you will make, not all of you, will be the spouse you choose,\" since \"you will move in the direction of the people that you associate with.\"  INSEAD professor Jennifer Petriglieri said on an episode of the Harvard Business Review's podcast \"Women at Work,\" that couples, in order to maximize both partners' satisfaction, should have a conversation twice yearly about what they're \"aiming for individually and together\" in the near future.  In fact, in the post-engagement interview, Markle mentioned that she and Prince Harry had had this type of conversation on an early date: \"It was really one of the first things we connected on, it was one of the first things we started talking about when we met, was just the different things that we wanted to do in the world and how passionate we were about seeing change.\"  In the same interview, Prince Harry responded to a question about whether he feels a sense of responsibility for Markle leaving acting behind. \"Of course,\" he said, adding that, \"I still have to have some pretty frank conversations with her to say, you know what you're letting yourself in for, it's a big deal, and it's not easy for anybody.\"  Prince Harry went on: \"Whatever we have to tackle together or individually, will always be us together as a team.\"  More on the royal wedding:\n",

But, according to royal expert Katie Nicholl, there's another very important royal in Harry's life to whom he turned for advice before popping the question: his sister-in-law, Kate Middleton . \"Harry and Kate are very close, she's been like a mentor to him and he wanted her seal of approval,\" a source told Nicholl in Grazia U.K. this week.  Beyond merely giving her approval to Harry's marriage, the Duchess of Cambridge has reportedly also made an effort to take Meghan under her wing since her and Harry's relationship turned serious. \"Kate is different to Meghan in many ways, but she has made great strides to help Meghan settle in,\" the source told Nicholl. \"It's a friendship that is still slowly blossoming. Kate has gone out of her way to be friendly to Meghan, and Meghan has been very grateful for that.\"  Nicholl reports that Kate has shown Meghan \"the royal ropes ,\" introduced her to several of her favorite designers , and told the newly titled Duchess of Sussex that she's \"always welcome\" in Apartment 1A of Kensington Palace, where Kate and Prince William live with their children . \"Kate has her hands full with the children and baby, but ensures she makes time to touch base with Meghan,\" the source said.

            "text: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are getting married one month from today.  Sorry, let us try that again, this time with the proper level of enthusiasm one should muster for such an announcement:  MEGHAN MARKLE AND PRINCE HARRY ARE GETTING MARRIED ONE MONTH FROM TODAY! EEEEEEK!!!!  That's better, don't you think?  But even though one month is a very small period of time until the Royal Wedding bells ring, those close to Markle reportedly think it's not small enough.  They wish the wedding were taking place tomorrow.  Because then they'd only have 24 hour left to deal what one source is describing as the ultimate Bridezilla.  Yes, this source is looking at you, Meghan Markle.  “Meghan’s driving everyone crazy with her diva demands,” an insider tells Life & Style, adding of the bride-to-be:  “She’s a perfectionist, and she’s trying to control everything going on around her.”  This is the first time we've heard of Markle being described as basically anything other than kind, generous, loyal, lovely and loving.  Aside from those racist trolls who gave Meghan and Harry problems early on in their romance due to the former's mixed heritage, Markle has received nothing but positive reviews for over a year now.  Everyone seems to adore her!  But weddings do have a way of causing such stress and tension for those prominently involved that it's nearly impossible not to snap on occasion.  And those are just regular weddings; with, like 75 to 100 guests.  Markle and Harry will be getting married in front of thousands of people lining the London streets, as well as millions more watching from home.  According to this tabloid source, the former Suits actress feels a lot of pressure to follow “the rules of royal etiquette” on her big day, but is also “worried about her family being on their best behavior.”  This last part is a bit unusual, however, because we're under the impression that almost no one from Markle's family is invited.  Just last week, Markle's controversial half-sister spoke out and complained about her lack of a wedding invite.  \"Humanitarians move forward with love and kindness especially to Family,\" Samanha Grant Tweeted about her snub, attempting to shame Markle into extending the invite.  So far, though, it has failed to work.  It is expected that Markle's parents will be in attendance, with her mom actually walking her down the aisle instead of her dad.  This is because Thomas Markle is famously shy.  He and Meghan's mother split a long time ago and Thomas now lives a very quiet life in Mexico. Sources have told The Sun that he's afraid to face the \"world’s glare\" on May 19.  But face it he will, at least in some capacity.  Just like those complaining about Markle's recent behavior, we're guessing Thomas will be happy when the wedding day comes and then goes.  What about YOU?  Are you sick of all this Royal coverage?  Or do you wish there was even more of it?\n",

It’s like a fortress.  “They both expect a code of silence”  Meghan Markle celebrates her 37th birthday at friend's lavish wedding Sun, August 5, 2018 Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry pictured at the wedding of Charlie Van Straubenzee and Daisy Jenks at the Church of St. Mary the Virgin, in Surrey Play slideshow REUTERS 1 of 17 Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, arrives at the wedding of Charlie Van Straubenzee and Daisy Jenks  “There’s a huge security presence, you can’t get close.” A source close to the couple said: “They spend a lot of time in the Cotswolds, more than people realise. “They are in the country way more than they are in London and enjoying a low-key and very domesticated start to married life.” The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are due to spend time with The Queen in Balmoral next month with the Duchess reportedly also keen to visit her mother in Los Angeles.  The couple are reportedly to be struggling with repeated outbursts from Thomas Markle, Meghan’s father. Last month Mr Markle provocatively claimed that Princess Diana would have “loathed” the way he was being treated by the Royal Family. Royal editor Camilla Tominey commented: “They have both been extremely upset by Thomas Markle’s behaviour and that of Meghan’s half sister Samantha and other relatives.  “They spend a lot of time in the Cotswolds, more than people realise\"\n",

            "text: Who is Prince Harry's father? That's what many fans are asking themselves ahead of the royal wedding. There have been rumors going around that Prince Charles isn't Prince Harry's real dad, so many fans are wondering if Harry and James Hewitt are actually father and son since they look alike. Scroll down to find out!  Is Prince Harry Charles' son?  Princess Diana's ex-lover recently confirmed that Charles is Prince Harry's biological father. In a previous interview with Australia's Sunday Night, James was asked, \"Are you Harry’s father?\" from the show's host. \"No, I’m not,\" the 60-year-old candidly admitted. He was then asked why he thought the truth of Harry’s paternity has been in constant doubt over the years. \"It sells papers. It’s worse for [Harry], probably, poor chap,\" James shared.  James in 2004. (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  James and Diana previously met in 1986, two years after Harry was born (Diana welcomed Harry with Charles in September 1984). The two were introduced around the same time Charles was rumored to be having an affair with his now-wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. However, James' claims prove that Charles is actually Harry's father (Phew!).  James reflected on his and Diana's whirlwind and private romance. \"It’s a gradual period and then, you know, suddenly you can’t get enough of each other or see each other as much as you want,\" he said, adding they had some great, low-key times together. \"I’d cook and she’d wash up. Just dinner and relaxing and laughing.\"  Their affair was soon exposed by the press, which led to their eventual split. Diana and Charles — who are also parents to a 35-year-old son, Prince William — later divorced in 1996 after 15 years of marriage. Diana died in a car crash in August 1997.  While Harry has expressed in the past that he's close with his dad, the red-headed royal also had a strong bond with his late mother and recently revealed how he's keeping her legacy alive through his charity work. \"I want to do something that makes my mother proud,\" he said. \"Lucky for me I've got the prince bit so I'm able to make a difference.\"  Join our Facebook group for the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Prince William, and all things royal!

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Meghan Markle is reportedly 'frustrated' by the strict royal protocols that govern her new life since marrying Prince Harry .  Members of the public watching Meghan's transformation from Hollywood actress into the Duchess of Sussex could be forgiven for thinking she'd taken to her new role with ease.  She made an effortless joint engagement with the Queen to open a new bridge, attended the RAF centenary flypast, was a guest of the Irish President alongside Harry, joined sister-in-law Kate Middleton at Wimbledon and looked stunning at Prince Louis' christening.  But she is reportedly confused about aspects of royal life and the old-fashioned ways of the Windsor household.  A source told People.com how Meghan \"has found certain rules in the royal household difficult to understand, like the fact that the Queen prefers women in dresses or skirts rather than trouser suits, and is often asking Harry why things have to be done in a certain way\".  (Image: Getty)  (Image: PA)  The source added: \"I think she finds it a little frustrating at times, but this is her new life, and she has to deal with it.”  The monarchy website includes a reference to Meghan as a \"feminist\".  She had never previously shied away from voicing her opinions on issues that were close to her heart.  But protocol prohibits royal family members from expressing political opinions.  There was no greater example of this than an Irish politician's recent blunder which revealed Meghan's opinions on the country's recent referendum on legalising abortion .  (Image: WPA Pool)  Senator Catherine Noone posted on Facebook : \"A pleasure to meet Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex at the British Ambassador's Residence this evening.  \"The Duchess and I had a chat about the recent referendum result - she watched with interest and was pleased to see the result.\"  The comments suggest that Meghan may have broken royal protocol by expressing political opinon.  Since the 17th century, members of the British monarchy have been banned from doing just that, which includes voting.  But from an early age, former Suits star Meghan was politically active.  Aged just 11 she successfully campaigned to have a washing detergent advert's sexist language changed.  She also said in 2016 she would move to Canada if \"misogynistic\" Donald Trump was elected US president.\n",

He took a moment during his Friday night concert at Madison Square Garden in New York to share the news.  Videos of the concert posted to social media show he took a break during one of his most well-known songs.  CLOSE Chris Stapleton joined Justin Timberlake at the latter's Bridgestone Arena concert for a performance of \\\"Say Something.\\\" Submitted, The Tennessean  \\\"I've got an announcement to make. Some of you may know that we have four children, and we just had twins about seven months ago,\\\" Stapleton said during a 14-minute version of the song \\\"Tennessee Whiskey.\\\"  \\\"Now there's four for us, but we're gonna make it five,\\\" he sang.  Stapleton's announcement nearly \\\"blew the roof off of Madison Square Garden,\\\" a concert-goer said.  \\\"The crowd was incredibly happy for them. It was probably the biggest reaction all night.\\\" Sean Roche, who captured the moment on film, said.  \\\"Tennessee Whiskey\\\" was the last song Stapleton played in the main set, Roche said, to a packed arena.  \\\"It's amazing. New York doesn't even have a country music station, and to fill up Madison Square Garden is pretty impressive,\\\" Roche said. Not typically a country fan, Roche saw Stapleton open for another act at a small New York venue a few years ago, and he said the musician made every jaw in the room drop.  When she announced the twins last year, Morgane Stapleton wrote on Instagram: \\\"14 years, two babies, and two more on the way. Happy 10 year anniversary babe. You make my whole world go round.\\\"  The longtime couple perform together, and she joined her husband on stage Friday night when he made the announcement.  Chris Stapleton posted photos and video from the Madison Square Garden show later that night on Instagram but did not mention the pregnancy news in the post.

And the night belonged to Bruno Mars.  Heading into the awards, Mars and Jay-Z led the nominations. But Mars ultimately swept the three biggest honors of the night, taking home Album of the Year and Record of the Year for 24k Magic and winning Song of the Year for \\u201cThat\\u2019s What I Like.\\u201d  Related 3 reasons why the 2018 Grammys fell so flat  Mars won six Grammys overall. In the end, Jay-Z was completely shut out and went home empty handed.  The Grammys handed out more than 80 golden gramophones in total, including in dozens of categories whose winners were announced shortly before the live telecast. Going into the ceremony, for example, Mars had already won three Grammys: Best R&B Album for 24K Magic and Best R&B Performance and Best R&B Song for \\u201cThat\\u2019s What I Like.\\u201d  Another big winner from the preshow awards was Kendrick Lamar, who won five Grammys total: He was honored with Best Rap Song, Best Rap Performance, and Best Music Video for \\u201cHUMBLE\\u201d during the preshow, and during the main ceremony, he won Best Rap/Sung Performance for \\u201cLoyalty\\u201d with Rihanna and Best Rap Album for DAMN.  Related The 9 best performances of the 2018 Grammys  Meanwhile, other notable \\u2014 and controversial \\u2014 wins from the live ceremony included Alessia Cara for Best New Artist (in an unfortunate snub of SZA) and Ed Sheeran for Best Pop Solo Performance, with his song \\u201cShape of You\\u201d (Sheeran somehow beat Kelly Clarkson, Lady Gaga, Kesha, and Pink, and he wasn\\u2019t even present to accept the award).
